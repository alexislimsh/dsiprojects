### By Alexis Lim, DSI-16

## Executive Summary

When it comes to housing prices, we often have access to extensive past data around housing features and the eventual sale price. Being able to predict future sale prices within a reasonable margin would be incredibly useful to many stakeholders, including housing agents, governing bodies and even residents themselves.

In this project, we process the Ames train and test datasets obtained via the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dsi-us-6-project-2-regression-challenge) hosted by General Assembly to find a robust model based on 25-30 variables for prediction of house sale price. We look at which features affect sale price the most through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis, and build and refine our model using various regression techniques.

## Problem Statement

What features of a house contribute most significantly to its eventual sale price, and with knowledge of these features, how can we predict future sale price?

We approach this question from the POV of a consultancy in Ames, Iowa, who is interested in an algorithm for housing sale prices that can take in the features in the dataset and return a predicted sale price. This model can then be marketed to both governing bodies and housing agents who would be interested in such a tool.

## Conclusion & Recommendations

We have successfully built a model with a relatively good RMSE based on the training dataset provided, and our examination has indicated that while the top influencing factor appears to be area (total square feet of the house and individual areas), variables across different aspects of the house were also picked out by the model to be significant.

*Recommendations*

Although the model generated was relatively successful, we should also note the following:

- The model is likely to have significant predictive power only within Iowa, Ames given that the city often has a large impact on price and may cause the features to interact in a different way. Hence, the use of the model is limited to one area and perhaps neighboring areas.

- The final model leverages quite a few interaction variables from a dataset that is already extremely comprehensive as it was collected by the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office. It is likely that users looking to predict sale price may not have details on all of the variables in the training dataset, while variables such as overall_qual and overall_cond are subjective. It may be fruitful to explore a simpler model that leverages on more accessible variables (e.g. lot_area, total_sf, basement type) which may give us a higher error, but can be generalised to more use cases.

- While we are able to process null values in the dataset by leveraging on other variables, an ideal scenario would be to reduce the null values at the collection stage. As many of the null values turned out to be Not Applicable or they were supposed to be zero values, there can be more standardisation in the data collection process.

While we see that the model built has limitations, it is also true that the process of putting together the model is informative and a similar process can be conducted for other datasets in other cities or with different variables collected. Our process is as follows:

- Clean and process data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Feature selection (by judgement and RFE and lasso techniques)
- Model iteration and optimisation

The last step should be ongoing if there is a stream of new data. Any model will have its limitations, but with the right set of assumptions and understanding of suitable use cases, we're able to predict meaningfully.
