LifeProTips,"I had a phone interview scheduled this morning, but accidentally slept through it. When I got up and saw that I missed it, I had the desperate urge to call and offer up excuses, in the hope that maybe, just maybe, they'd be understanding and give me another chance. 

Instead, all I did was apologize and ask if we could reschedule. That's it, one sentence, no additional information, no explanation or excuse as to why I missed the first interview. 

They replied within 20 minutes, apologizing to ME, saying it was probably their fault, that they'd been having trouble with their computer system for days, and of course I could reschedule, was I available that afternoon?

LifeProTips,"I've probably listened to my mum tell one particularly cringe worthy story dozens of times and I think everyone she knows has been told it. Every time she tells it, most of the time in front of me, I just want to crawl under the table and hide. However, that would give her another humiliating story to tell.

Just because you're a parent doesn't mean you have a right to humiliate them for a laugh.

I do think that telling about something cute they once did (pronouncing something wrong, for example) is different to an embarrassing story, but if your child doesn't like you telling about it then you should still find something else to talk about.

Edit: I mean telling stories from any part of your child's life at any part of your child's life. When I say child, I don't mean only someone under 18, I mean the person that is your child.

Edit again: This post blew up, can't believe how big it has gotten. Getting a lot of comments from the children (including adult children) involved but also parents which is awesome.

Im also getting a lot of comments about how this is a self-selecting sample and in the wider world, not as many people would support this. All I have to say is that just because there is another 50,000 people out there (or whatever number) who wouldn't care about this doesn't mean that the 50,000 here matter any less. It's not about proportion, its about that number existing in the first place. How do you know if the person you are talking about isn't one of those 50,000 people?

There is a much, much more constructive way to teach your child to be less sensitive. I laugh with my kid, not at him. We do it when we're on our own or in safe groups. If he tells me something funny he did, I laugh with him and I'll tell him stupid things I do so we can laugh together.

I don't humiliate him with personal and embarrassing stories around Christmas dinner or whatever. It's about building people up, not breaking them down.

LifeProTips,"I’m a mechanic/auto shop owner. I figured I’d put some stuff together for anyone interested in buying a used car but doesn’t know anything about cars. Obviously the best option is to take it to an auto shop to have it thoroughly inspected by a professional before you buy it. The key word here is BEFORE you buy it. I don’t know how many people I’ve had come to my shop for an inspection after they bought it….ugghh. The $150 or so you spend is worth not buying something that may have thousands of dollars of problems. But if that’s not an option, here are some tips to help keep you from buying a lemon:

1-Buy a cheap OBD scanner/reader. You don’t need to spend a lot, as they’ll all do what you need here. A bluetooth OBD reader and the TORQ app for you phone seems to be pretty popular/good choice. Practice using it on some cars. Some of the stuff I'm going over may seem daunting, but if you practice it on a car a few times, you'll get the hang of it, and this will all make sense. You could be saving yourself thousands in repair here, so take a few hours to practice it. It's not hard once you do. You should be able to do all of the stuff I'm going to talk about with your scanner in under 5 mins total. You don’t have to worry about reading and interpreting data. The main thing you want to do is check for codes in the engine and transmission ECUs. ECU stands for Electronic Contrul Unit. Basically, it's the computer that controls the engine or transmission. They are sometimes referred to as ECM, or Engine Control Module, and TCM, or Transmission Control Module. Sometimes they'll be referred to as PCM, or Powertrain Control Module. This is what it's called when only one computer controls both the engine and automatic transmission. The PCM may be one physical computer, but logically, it's 2 computers. So if you connect your scanner to a PCM, you'll still see two separate options, one for engine, and one for transmission. Do note that if you have a manual transmission, there won't be a transmission computer.

So when you connect to each one, there should be no codes in either. If there are codes, there’s an issue. It may be minor, it may be major. Google it if you want, but not knowing what the codes mean, your best bet is to walk away. If your scanner is a better one, you can also check other modules (computers) for codes. However, it’s pretty common on newer cars, especially European, to find obscure codes in obscure modules. Normally they’re not an issue. Focus on the Engine and Transmission. ABS (antilock brakes) and SRS (safety restrain system...airbags, seat belts, etc) modules normally shouldn’t have codes lingering either. Make sure to also check after test driving. The codes may have been reset by the seller to hide a problem (more on that in the next paragraph). They may have returned during your test drive, so check again!

Use the scanner to check the monitors on the engine ECU/Computer. Monitors are a series of self checks that the ECU does on the engine. All applicable monitors should be set (passed/complete). They get reset when you clear the check engine light, or when you disconnect the battery (usually). If all of the monitors haven’t passed, then it’s quite likely the person selling it has reset the check engine light recently (may be trying to hide a problem), or there’s a problem that isn’t allowing the monitor to complete. Not a good sign.  Walk away. To complete all of the monitors can take quite a few miles and sometimes several days. So there's a good window there for you to catch someone doing some hanky panky.

2. Crank the engine without starting it. What you want to do is listen to the engine during a continuous crank. On American cars and on Mazdas, this is easy, as they have what’s known as a Clear Flood Mode. You turn the key to the on position, wait a few seconds, depress the gas pedal all the way, then try to start it. The engine will crank away without starting for as long as you hold the key (or in the case of a push button start, until you hit the button again). If the engine starts, quickly let off the gas so you don’t revv up the engine too high and try it again. You’ll want to listen to it for a good 10 seconds or so. This is a very easy way to check compression on an engine. The main thing you hear when cranking an engine is the electric starter working to try and spin the engine. As a piston comes up and compresses the air, the starter has to work harder to spin the engine, and the speed/pitch of the starter changes. Once the piston comes back down, it’s easier to spin the engine, so the speed/pitch changes back, and then repeats as each consecutive piston moves up in the compression stroke. Every engine sounds different, but they all should have a very steady rhythmic starting noise. Kind of a WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA WAAA. If one or more of the cylinders has low compression, you will hear the starter have an off-rhythmic sound that repeats. So for instance, if you have a 4 cylinder engine with one low compression cylinder, it would sound like WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA WAAA WAAA WA WAAA etc. Every 4th pitch change will sound different than the other 3.

For reference, here’s what a normal cranking sound should be: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h\_Ygqox0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6v0h_Ygqox0)

Here’s what a low compression cylinder cranking sounds like. It’s at about :55 secs :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOghpmVhVng)

If you listen closely, you’ll hear the unsteady rhythm. Loss of compression is usually piston rings, valves, or head gasket. All costly. If the engine sounds funny when cranking, walk away.

If the car you’re looking at doesn’t have a clear flood mode, you can remove the fuel pump relay in the engine compartment fuse box, which turns off the fuel pump. Most cars have one, but some don’t. Some cars can be a real PITA to disable it from starting. Google the car you’re looking at with something like “YYYY Make Model clear flood” or  “YYYY Make Model disable fuel pump” and see if there’s an easy way to achieve this. I'm sure there will be a Youtube video showing you exactly how to do this.

Practice this beforehand on cars you have access to if possible to tune your ear to the sound. You can also do this periodically on your own car to see if any problems are arising.

3. Check the fluids. All of the fluids will have minimum/maximum marks. If fluids are low, someone has not been maintaining the car well, or it has developed a leak. Not a good sign. When checking the engine oil, it should range from clear to black. If it looks like chocolate milkshake, there is a major problem. RUN AWAY. You can also smell the oil on the dipstick to see if it smells like gasoline. If it smells like raw gasoline, the engine is either injecting way too much fuel or you have bad piston rings. Either way they're bad. If the oil level is WAY above the full mark, like an inch or more, then either some other fluid is making it's way into the engine (very bad) or someone sucks at doing an oil change. Remember to check the oil with the engine off and on level ground. Some new cars don’t have dipsticks (mainly European). If so, you’re SOL. Check the coolant in the reservoir. It should be green, pink, red, yellow, orange, blue, or purple, depending on manufacturer. If it’s rusty, walk away. Remove the radiator cap (only if the engine is cold) and look at the cap and in the radiator. If you see any rust or chunky/gritty brown stuff, walk away. If it’s just water, walk away (be careful here, Ford’s yellow coolant almost looks clear). Check the automatic transmission fluid. For the most part, it should be red, but sometimes amber or green. It may be black. That’s dirty. Not a deal breaker, but they haven’t been keeping up on maintenance. It should not smell burnt, though. That’s bad. If it looks like strawberry milkshake, that’s really bad. Also, remember that you should check the level on automatic transmissions while the engine is running in Park and after driving it and getting the transmission good and hot. The only exception is most Hondas. That’s checked after driving but with the engine off. Google it for the car you plan on looking at to make sure. Many new cars don’t have a transmission dipsticks, so again, you’re SOL there.

4. Start the engine and listen for any noises. The engine should be cold. If it’s at operating temperature, the seller may have warmed it up to hide some cold start engine noises. Be wary. If it makes any noises, walk away.

5. Look for maintenance records. If it has consistent oil change records at an oil change place, at least they’ve been changing the oil. Unfortunately, oil change places only check easy profitable stuff. It’s better than nothing, though. If the records are all at an independent shop, that’s better. Indy’s will usually do a pretty thorough check up on the car when servicing it. If it has all dealer records, that’s the holy grail. Dealers will find any nick nack that’s wrong and upsell it. They also commonly don’t do thorough diagnostics (this is an unfortunate effect of the way dealer shops operate). So if it needed repairs, on top of having new parts that needed replacing, it may have other new parts that it didn’t even need. Plus those new parts will be good quality OEM parts, not chines junk of questionable quality.

6. Check that everything works on the car. Check the A/C, the heater, the windows, the locks, the mirrors, the head/parking/brake lights, etc. If the owner neglected to fix obvious problems, what else did they decide not to fix?

7. Look under the hood and look for any hokey work. Random zip ties holding things on, tape, broken plastic pieces, a battery that can move around if you push on it, wires hanging, etc. If it looks like unprofessional work has been done on what you can see, how bad is what you can’t see?

8. How does the car look? Is it dirty, full of scratches, stained? If the owner cares so little about the interior/exterior, they probably have the same attitude towards the mechanical part of it.

9. Check the tires. Aside from general condition, do they all match? If all the tires are different, they’re cheap/broke, and have probably cheaped out on a lot more than just tires. Lay your hand flat on the tire tread and light feel around the tires. If you feel a repeating pattern of flat spots/dips, you have suspension problems.

10. Try and stay away from used car dealers. Used car dealers get the majority of their cars from auctions. A lot of cars that go to auction are sent there by someone that doesn’t want it, usually because there are problems. Not all, but many. New car dealers send trade-ins that are too old or the wrong make to put on their lot, and some of those are decent. However, the small used car dealers usually buy the bottom of the barrel cars at auction. They’ll fix the minimum needed with the cheapest parts possible to maximize profit. They’ll make it look pretty, though. Good chance you’re buying a polished turd. Not all used car dealers are bad, though. Check reviews. Look at what they have on the lot. If they have a lot of high resale value cars on the lot, they're buying the good stuff at acution. If all of their cars are under $10k, with a lot under $5k, move on.

11. Obviously, test drive the car. Drive it at different speeds up to highway speeds. Brake easy, brake hard. Find a crappy road or railroad tracks to drive over. Make sure there are no noises or vibrations. Get it good and warm. When you’re done, open the hood and take a good whiff. Make sure there are no strong smells (like burning fluids or other things). Look under the car and see if anything is dripping or the bottom of the engine is covered in fluids (bring a flashlight, it can get dark under there). Don’t be alarmed if you see water dripping under the car at about the same area as the base of the windshield/firewall. If the A/C or defroster was on, that is just condensate from the A/C system. Touch it. If it’s not oily and looks/feels like water, it should be OK. If you’re test driving a manual car, the clutch engagement point should be somewhere in the middle of the clutch pedal travel. If it’s right at the top or right at the bottom, clutch repairs are in the near future.

12. This one is a little more advanced, but not too difficult. It’s also pretty important. You’ll need your OBD scanner. What you want to do is look at the engine data and search for the fuel trims. An engine computer injects fuel based on a bunch of sensor inputs. It has a base fuel map programmed into it that it references, based on those sensor inputs, and injects XXX amount of fuel. There is an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system that analyzes the exhaust gas and acts like a quality control inspector. It tells the computer whether it injected too much or too little fuel. The computer then makes adjustments to that base fuel map to make sure it’s injecting the proper amount of fuel. Those adjustments are called fuel trims. A 5% fuel trim would mean the computer had to add 5% more fuel than the base map. A -5% fuel trim would mean that the computer had to reduce fuel by 5% from the base fuel map. In a perfect world, fuel trims would be zero. However, that’s rarely the case. Fuel quality, different atmospheric conditions, engine wear, engine or sensor problems, etc, make it so that the base fuel map is never perfect, so the computer is always adding or subtracting fuel (usually it’s adding, but sometimes it’s subtracting). I don’t like to see a computer adding or subtracting more than 10% fuel. Any more than that and there may be a problem. Any more than 15-20% and there is definitely a problem.

So what you’re going to want to do is look at the data on the engine computer. You want to make sure you connect to the computer using the GENERIC OBD2 option on your scanner. Different car manufacturers will call these fuel trims by different names, and display the percentage in different ways. If you connect to the engine computer the standard way, you may be confused trying to find and read the fuel trims. But if you connect using the generic obd option, it’s always going to use a standardized display format across all vehicles. Some really cheap OBD scanners only connect using the generic OBD protocol. You’re going to see a long list of a bunch of different data. Scroll through until you find “short term fuel trim” and “long term fuel trim”. I'm not going to explain what the difference between those two data parameters are, as that doesn't matter here, and may end up being confusing. I'm just going to tell you what to do with the values you see.

Short term fuel trim, depending on your scanner, may be displayed as: Short term fuel trim, STFT, ST, or ST%

Long term fuel trim may be displayed as: Long Term Fuel Trim, LTFT, LT, or LT%

Let’s assume your scanner uses the more common STFT and LTFT designation. You’re going to see a number after the letters, so STFT1 and LTFT1. The number means the “bank” or side of the engine. A 4 cylinder engine only has one “side” so you’ll only see STFT1 and LTFT1. However, a V6 or V8 engine has two sides of the engine (3 or 4 cylinders on one side, and 3 or 4 cylinder on the other side, hence the V6 or V8). The computer controls fuel independently for each side of the engine, so you’ll see a STFT1 and LTFT1 for one side of the engine, and STFT2 and LTFT2 for the other side. Don’t be alarmed if you’re looking at a V6 or V8 engine and you only see STFT1 and LTFT1. Many late 90s cars and some early 2000s cars didn’t control fuel separately for each side of the engine, and lumped both sides into one bank.

When looking at the short term and long term fuel trims, you’ll notice the long term fuel trim number stays pretty steady, but the short term fuel trim number may change a lot. This is normal. What is important to note is that they are cumulative. So if STFT=4 and LTFT=3, then your total fuel trim is 7%. Let’s take a look at some examples on a V8:

STFT1 : 3 ...  STFT2 : 6

LTFT1 : 2 ...  LTFT2  : 1

So the total fuel trim on bank 1 is 5% (3+2) and the total fuel trim on bank 2 is 7% (6+1). Each bank is below +/- 10%. That’s pretty good.

STFT1 : -5 ...  STFT2  : 3

LTFT1 : 3 ...   LTFT2  : 1

Bank 1 fuel trim is -2% (-5 +3) and bank 2 is 4% (3+1). Again, that’s good.

STFT1 :  6 ...  STFT2 :  7

LTFT1  : 10  ... LTFT2  :15

Bank 1 fuel trim is 16% (6+10) and bank 2 is 22% (7+15). That’s not good. Walk away from this one.

Here's one more that's a littlte different:

STFT1  : -20 ...  STFT2  : -20

LTFT1  :  22 ...  LTFT2  : 20

Hey, 2% and 0% total fuel trim on each bank. SWEET! this car is running almost perfect! Well not really. Why is the LTFT adding 22% but then the STFT is taking  a bunch of it back? There may be an intermittent issue going on here. So add the absolute values together as well (treat -20 as 20) and see what that total is. Here we have 42 and 40. There's some interpretation required here that you'd need some experience to do, but I'd say anything over 25 when adding absolutes is cause for concern.

Check these numbers with the engine running at idle, and rev up the engine and hold it at about 2500rpms and check it there. Like I said, you may see the STFT number change pretty quickly, so just use the average of the numbers you see for that one. If you have someone with you, you can have them check the numbers while you drive as well.

Practice this on a car you have access to beforehand.

13. Last and not least, don’t trust the person selling the car. Trust your eyes, your ears, and your instinct. You don’t know this person, they may be lying about the car, or try and tell you that the thing you’re worried about is no big deal, it’s just this or that. Or they had a guy check it out and it’s a really easy/quick fix. Be patient and find the right car. If something is fishy or doesn’t seem right, move on to the next car. A car is a pretty big expense. Most people budget for the purchase price of a car and don’t consider there may be considerable extra expense in fixing major problems. Minimize the possibility of those extra expenses by inspecting the car the best you can.

I would recommend running through these things, and any others you want to add, on your current car, your parents’ cars, friends’ cars, etc. Do it several times. Get comfortable in making these checks so that when you’re doing them in front of some stranger on their car, you won’t forget anything.

I totally forgot to talk about Titles and their pitfalls. u/BossMaverick has made an excellent post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/egs81p/lpt_some_tips_for_buying_a_used_car_for_people/fcc67tp/?context=3) talking about it, and a few other good things as well.

&#x200B;

EDIT- Forgot another tip regarding possible accident repairs. When you look under the hood, the color of the metal in the engine compartment area should be the same color as the car. If you see different colors or primer, it's had body repair. Also, if you look at the reflection in the car's exterior paint up close and at an angle, you'll notice that the reflection has a wavy pattern to it. That's called orange peel. Every car has it from the factory, except super high end cars. The orange peel pattern should be consistent all the way around the car. If the pattern changes in certain parts of the car, it's been repainted in that area. Good chance it had an accident. Another thing you can do is take a small magnet with you. You're going to place the magnet against the car in as many areas as you can. Make sure you wrap it in a microfiber towel or something  soft so you don't scratch the car (it's not your car). The magnet should attract itself to the body and even stick to it. If there are spots where the magnet doesn't stick as strong or at all, there is body filler there. It's had body work. Do keep in mind that some body panels aren't magnetic on some cars. If you can't get the magnet to stick anywhere on an entire panel (like the fender or hood) then you probably have a non magnetic body panel (maybe fiberglass or aluminum). I guess it's possible that the whole body panel is covered in bondo, but that would be rare, as that would be an extremely poor repair.

1. The government will not ask you to pay anything up front to get this money. No fees. No charges. No nothing.

2. The government will not call to ask for your Social Security number, bank account, or credit card number. Anyone who does is a scammer.

3. These reports of checks aren’t yet a reality. Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer.

Predict that the scammers are gearing up to take advantage of this.  So, remember: no matter what this payment winds up being, only scammers will ask you to pay to get it.

LifeProTips,"In light of the class action lawsuit against Google for continuing to track visitors' private sessions, I went down a rabbit hole to see if it was possible to avoid being ""fingerprinted"" by websites like Amazon & Google.

Turns out, it's almost impossible. There is literally almost *nothing* you can do to stop these websites from tracking your actions. I can't believe there haven't been MASSIVE class-action lawsuits against these companies before now. The current private-browsing suit doesn't even scratch the surface.

Even when you delete your Cookies, clear your Cache, and use a VPN or a browser like Brave (effectively telling websites you do NOT want to be tracked), these websites will still track & build every action you take into a robust profile about who you are, what you like, and where you go.

This goes deeper than just websites. Your Spotify music history is added into this profile, your Alexa searches, your phone's GPS data, any text you have typed into your phone, and more. Companies like Amazon and Google purchase all of this and build it into your profile.

So when you are 'Fingerprinted' by these websites, it's not just your past website history they are attaching to your session. It's **every single thing about you.**

This should be illegal; consumers should have the right to private sessions, should they chose. During this time of quarantine, there is no alternative option: we are forced to use many of these sites. As such, this corporate behavior is unethical, immoral, and in legal terms, a contract of adhesion as consumers are forced into wildly inappropriate terms that erase their privacy.

**TL;DR LPT**: You are being fingerprinted and tracked by Google, Amazon, every other major website.

LifeProTips,"Just lost my pop to a long fight with Alzheimer's. It sucked watching the kind, warm, and generous man I knew become a shell of his former self.   


During his decline, he showed all the hallmarks of the disease: forgetting family faces and names, telling stories about false memories, and, in the end, a bit of belligerence (the kind you might typically see in a toddler).   


Throughout his decline, I saw my family approach it in one of two ways: some would try to correct his mistakes over and over (to no avail), and some would just roll with the punches.   


Playing along with things in the moment always seemed to keep him more centered and grounded. Not only did it help calm him down, it made those painful visits a little less so by knowing he felt comforted by my validating his reality, and not trying to yank him out of whatever timeline/alternate universe he was visiting.   


A simple example would be if he asked where his (long dead) mother was, I would just say ""she's visiting with your sister and will be back soon."" What good would correcting him do? Then he'd have to re-live that trauma of losing his mom all over again, possibly many times a day.   


Or when he would say something outlandish like, ""I used to be a senator, you know"" I would just say, ""oh that's right, I forgot all about that, tell me more!""   


I have to give credit to a [TEDMED talk](https://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=526821) that I saw describing this whole approach, many years ago. I'm so glad I saw it because it absolutely changed the way I spent time with my dad, and made it easier, richer, and more gratifying in spite of the misery of the disease.

LifeProTips,"Let me start by saying I'm not an* idiot. I usually can spot a scam. Today, I didn't. 
 
So I'm sure this has been said before in some shape, form, and/or fashion, but let me tell you how good these hackers are. Today I received a call from BBT. THE CALL CAME FROM BBT. From their* number I have personally called many times and have saved in my phone as BBT. It was their* fraud department and they wanted to let me know that there is suspicious activity on my account. A few minutes of verifying info and everything was cleared up. My account was locked and a new card was ordered. I was given a 1 time use login and password to re-setup my BBT online account and was told to allow 6-8 hours for everything to take effect.  Or so I thought. 
 
Within a few hours, I was wiped clean. $1.26 left in my bank. So I call BBT back to find out what's going on. I find out that I did not speak to BBT earlier today. I had instead been call spoofed by hackers and that I actually gave them all the info they needed (or better phrased, the last little bit of info they were looking for) to wipe my ass clean of all my money. I talked to the service guy for about 30mins. We hopefully have it official straighten out now. With my account actually locked and a legit new card on the way. There is a chance I may have to get a whole new account period. 
 
The one thing the service guy told me was that if I ever get a call from (my bank) to hang up and call back at a number I know is theirs. If it truly was them, they will know what the call was for. If they have no idea of any reason to call you, you were called by a hacker.
 
Edit: This has gained a massive amount of traction. I would like to thank this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/ejq9oy/ysk_to_never_trust_a_call_from_your_bank_always/fczynoa?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) for the idea to post it here. It has been interesting reading all the stories. Some with similar outcomes, some with way better outcomes. Either way, it has been a nice topic of discussion. 
 
If nothing else, I hope this post saves at least one other person from going through what I went through.

2 week edit. As it sits right now, the money has been refunded (minus an overdraft fee incurred during the event), new account has been made, new card has been received. 
 

 
To clear up some misconceptions, here's is some added info. 
 
1. BBT called me. It was not an unknown number. It was BBT's main contact number you can find on the back of your card. I usually do not answer the phone for anyone that isn't family. What led me to answer it that morning was that I had already received a fraud alert text from BBT about 5 mins before. Turns out, that was fake as well. BBT only uses one short code messaging system. 
 
2. I didn't give them any personal info. My SSN was not shared. My account number, routing number, or debit card number was not given out by me. They already had (almost) all the info they needed. My address, my telephone number on file, the email used for my account, the debit card ""that was hacked"". They used the info they had to tie my card to Google Pay. They only thing they needed was the code that got sent to my phone. Actually 2 codes. One to reset my password for the app, and one to add the card to Google Pay. He played it off that the first code had expired and had to send another one. He said the code was to ""lock"" the online account so that the fraud could be looked into. 
 
3. This LPT, like many others on here, is not accurate 100% of the time. They can and might call you. They should never make you verify your info. If you read the comments though, it is definitely a great practice if you get suspicious. Hang up and call from a different land line number or a cell phone. Read the comments for more info on the different land line stuff. 
 
4. The amount of money that was taken is kinda irrelevant. $1000 to me, is different then $1000 to you. Or to the guy living paycheck to paycheck. The part that matters is that it was everything I had at the moment. The spending money for a weekend date. Junk food for the kids while we are out on our date. Running money for 2 weeks. You get the idea. All gone. (Luckily, we had gift cards from Xmas and still got our date night.)

LifeProTips,"Example: You get an expensive bill for a $1,000 unfortunately. U.S. healthcare really shouldn’t be so expensive in the first place...but the first thing you should do is call and ask for a review of the level of care, and while on the phone the next thing you do is ask for an itemized bill with every single charge. 

They make bills unnecessarily expensive because in the backend of things, they rack up ridiculous charges like $37 for a bandaid. Once you call and request what I’ve mentioned, they’ll knock all the BS charges right off before sending you the itemized statement.
 
Some bills can go down from $500 to $45. It may not be that drastic for everyone, but many can be reduced by several hundreds of dollars.

If you or anyone you know has been to the ER recently, tell them to try this. It can majorly help!

You can try to even further this by looking for medical debt reconciliation companies. They make money by cutting down on your debt, even in cases like these.

If you have insurance, you can contact your insurance company and ask for a breakdown of what was billed as well.  Most services you were billed for likely weren’t even done. So yes ALWAYS ask for an itemized bill, they get scared and remove a whole bunch of items!

You can also apply for medical financial assistance (MFA). Every hospital has it, you just need to submit financial info and they will pay it all or half. Sometimes you can even get medicine and visits waived for 6 months or more. 

Another thing you can do for extra help is ask to apply for charity. The charity department will ask questions about your income situation however, but many people do lie about their income. There’s a chance you’ll get approved and your account is adjusted to zero balance.

EDIT: this may be a bit simplified and there’s some contradictory statements in the comments, but I don’t think you should be discouraged from trying it because it has 100% WORKED for many... such as people in this thread saying it reduced their bill firsthand, hospital employees confirming this, genuine comments on twitter of people sharing their experience with it and how much it lowered their bill, and other videos of people explaining their situation showing gratitude for having learned this info because it saved them a lot of money... no “propaganda” or angrily fueled desire to spread misinformation. Many of these people didn’t get much recognition for sharing their experience either, it’s not like they’re just lying to go viral.

LifeProTips,"This honestly is the single thing that bystanders do to make my job hardest. Blocking the door can really hamper my access to the patient, when you actually just want to help me.

Context: For every job in my metropolitan ambulance service, I'm carrying at least a cardiac monitor weighing about 10kg, a drug kit in the other hand, and usually also a smaller bag containing other observation gear. For a lot of cases, I'll add more bags: an oxygen kit, a resuscitation kit, an airway bag, sometimes specialised lifting equipment. We carry a lot of stuff, and generally the more I carry, the more concerned I am about the person I'm about to assess.

It's a very natural reflex to welcome someone to your house by holding the door open. The actual effect is to stand in the door frame while I try to squeeze past you with hands full. Then, once I've moved past you, I don't know where to go.

**Instead, it's much more helpful simply to open the door and let me keep it open myself, then simply lead the way.** I don't need free hands to hold the door for myself, and it clears my path to walk in more easily.

Thanks. I love the bystanders who help me every day at work, and I usually make it a habit to shake every individual's hand on a scene and thank them as a leave, when time allows.

2. So many photos. All of them. You can't go overboard. I will sit there and go through every photo with them every day, if you want me to. I really don't mind.

I have now worked in a geriatric psychiatric ward too- and these 90 year old women who have literally been assaulted by their once-loving husbands at 2am have to hear your fucking bullshit about how they can’t care for their spouse and what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus Christ use your brain. Maybe your grandma insists that she needs to get to the bus stop at 4pm, right when you’re getting home from work every day- do you want to quit your job because she can’t stop wandering into the street?

As the program director, I am in charge of scheduling, coordinating, and facilitating the activities. I either lead the activity or I delegate it to an aide who works in the afternoon. I interact with and update the families as necessary or on a schedule. I come up with creative solutions to behavioral problems and advise/inform staff and management on layouts of how to address concerns resulting from cognitive impairment.

So most of us have spent some amount of time worrying that we're not attractive and no one will want us in ""that"" way. Because hey, we all have some certain set of flaws with our bodies or our faces, right?

But here's the thing I finally figured out. For each kind of a flaw that you might have, there is some certain set of people out there who literally just don't care at ALL about that flaw (or maybe even like it better).

And even if you think you have a *number* of flaws, there's still *some* number of people out there who don't give a shit about *any* of those things at all.

And so get this, to those people's eyes, who don't see the flaws -- you're a ""ten"". They're not ""settling"" for you. You're just the hottest fucking thing they've ever seen.

And there's more of them than you think.

So forget about the flaws and get busy being your hot as fuck self.

LifeProTips,"Once you start blabbing the cops will write down things you say. Even one slip up or misspoken word can now be used as testimony against you.

Sometimes cops can’t remember everything you say in the moment so they write it down later.

LifeProTips,"It’s also going to help build skills in communicating things clearly, precisely and in a way anybody can understand. You’ll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think “wait, why do we do it like that?!” - identifying opportunities for improvement.

Edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. For some extra help / elucidation:

-	I found this very helpful when I was starting my career. The biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out “on paper” to better see where things need to change, where I didn’t know all I could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	I am indeed now a director. Our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. It’s those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; I can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. As a manager, it’s a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. I’m never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it’s because they’ve found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	Most importantly, where I’m from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they’ve been forced to “work themselves out of a job” then they can sue for constructive dismissal. I know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it’s not a common motif. As such, I do agree that if you’re in a country like India, China, USA, where some of these protections and freedoms aren’t so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. In others, like Germany, UK, most of Scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

But yes, as with anything - this has been an experience I’ve personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation.

LifeProTips,"As a first point, you should always push back on discussing salary as close to an offer being made as possible. The more they are imagining you being a part of their team, the better the negotiating position you have.

Once you're at that point, ask them what their range is. Your goal is to understand where you fit within the range. The more of the essential and desirable points in the job spec you meet, the higher up the range you'll be able to negotiate.

However – and this is the important bit – if they come back and say 'they don't have a range', then it's almost always a lie (I'll come back to when it isn't in a minute). As someone who has either directly hired, or been involved in hiring over 40 employees across different industries, there's one constant. If you don't have sign off from HR and finance (potentially via a senior manager), then there isn't a position to hire for.

To get sign off from those two crucial departments, you need a budget (the range) so the company can ensure that they will be able to afford the new hire, and that the salary is less than the ROI they will bring to the company.

(It's also good to know that it can sometimes be worth pushing for a little over the defined range. I once had a company come back with a £6k offer above the top end of their budget because they hadn't expected to find someone at my level. They'd under budgeted and were competing against three other solid offers – all above the original top end of their budget).

Now the only time that this might not apply is if they are hiring for a highly specialised position (either technical, or executive/c-suite level) where they need to pay whatever the market is demanding. But the chances are with those positions, you'll have a recruiter handling the negotiations who knows standard market rates and will be pushing for as high a salary as possible without going over what's reasonable, because their commission is usually a percentage of the accepted offer.

If the job you're interviewing for doesn't fall into those above categories, then be very careful – especially when there's a deliverable involved in the interview process. Sometimes unscrupolous companies have been known to use fake jobs to farm ideas from highly qualified candidates without having to pay them for them.

And even if that isn't the case, consider carefully whether you really want to work for a company where there is a culture of lying to you before you've even been hired.",48215,"LPT: When negotiating a salary for a new job, always ask them what their range is.

LifeProTips,"I owned a dry cleaners for 5 years, and before that, used to work in one for 10 years, both front and back end. I know the whole process. I'm going to spill the secrets on garments you should never bring to a dry cleaners because you are being ripped off.

EDIT: Disclaimer: My experience in the business may not be necessarily reflective of ALL dry cleaners so take that into consideration.

DOWN JACKETS -  Down items are expensive. It could cost $40 to have a down coat cleaned. Down items have to be washed by themselves, lest they spill feathers onto other items, so that's why they're so expensive, to ensure profit from the isolated load. Down coats are rarely dry-cleaned, but laundered, and then hung to dry overnight, and then placed in a dryer for a few minutes to plump out the feathers, and good to go. Down items are not pressed. You could wash a down jacket yourself, hang it to dry, and get the same processing

COMFORTERS - Never bring a comforter to a dry cleaner unless it specifically says ""dry-clean only.""  Dry cleaner owners won't dry clean a comforter unless they have to, because it's cheaper to launder. Comforters can range from $39.99 or higher and you're getting less quality than you would at a laundromat. Comforters are rarely ever spotted for stains, and they're laundered in a basic commercial wash machine with a standard setting, hung to dry over night to save on drying time, then placed in the commercial dryer, and then finished. If your comforter had any bad odor before you brought it in, it probably is still going to have that odor. You're better off paying $5 at a laundromat, and choosing your own cycle and spin settings.

SPOT-CLEAN ONLY DRESSES - Many customers don't check or understand their care labels, and dry cleaners love that. Some formal dresses are ""spot-clean only"", which means, it can't be washed in the conventional way.  It might fancy sequins glued to the fabric, which dry cleaning will melt and damage the dress. Dry cleaning is oil-based and will melt glue and plastic. Dry cleaners may charge you up to $30-50 due to the fanciness of the dress, when they can't even clean it. They may go over the spots and individually spot and treat them, or, at best, hand wash the item by soaking it in cold water, and hang drying overnight, nothing you can't do at home. Again, with the fancy sequins, the item typically can't be pressed.

WEDDING DRESSES - Wedding dressed could cost up to $200 even though they are dry cleaned the same way as a $6 pair of pants, but, if you bring a wedding dress, NEVER opt for the preservation box. Dresses are more if you get the preservation box, which adds $50 or more to the cost - but dry cleaners DO NOT press wedding dresses that get placed in the box, which is typically there for an indefinite period. By the time the customers opens it 3 years later to notice it isn't pressed, it's too late to take back to the cleaners for a redo.  So you're paying more money for the dress WITHOUT the pressing. You get more for your money if you buy the preservation box elsewhere, and put it in there yourself after you get your dress cleaned and pressed.

LEATHER: Leather is the most expensive item to clean, around $50 for a coat, but dry cleaners rarely ever do leather on premises, but send it out to a third party leather cleaner. So you're paying more than what the dry cleaner pays to have it cleaned. Also, there is no special Leather dry cleaning method. Leather is simply lightly spot cleaned with a dish-soap leather formula and then hung to air dry in a moisture-free environment overnight. You're essentially just paying for the labor charge. To save money, you could lightly go over the jacket yourself with Dawn soap, water, and a microfiber towel.

&#x200B;

WORTH IT:

MEN'S BUTTON-UP SHIRTS - Men's shirts only cost around $1.25-$2 a shirt, They're laundered by the bulk and then heat-pressed on their own machine in less than 20 seconds. Dry cleaners don't make their money off of this, so it's a great value to the customer.

WOOL PEACOATS - Wool peacoat are notorious for getting lint on them, and they're dry-clean only. Counter employees will often remove the lint by scraping and shaving the fabric so it looks much nicer at pick-up.

Oil/grease spill - Dry cleaning is oil-based and will absorb oils on fabric such as food, yellow body perspiration, motor oil, that water can't get. If you get oil on your fabric, it's worth it to request dry cleaning at a dry cleaners. It's especially great for removing the yellow body oil stains around the armpit and collar areas.

Also want to add the benefit of opting for""press only.""  Baseball/hockey jerseys cannot be dry-cleaned as it will melt the logos. They are laundered. However they do look nice when pressed. So you could save money by washing items like jerseys and Polo golf shirts yourself and then bringing them in for ""press only"" if its the pressing you like - and save a few euros off the price.

Bottom-line: To get the most of your money, if you drop something off at the dry cleaners, make sure it can benefit from the professional-grade pressing.

LifeProTips,"EDIT: Some information to prevent myself from having to facepalm in response to some of these comments.

For a complete overview of the pathogenesis of the rhinovirus (a virus responsible for the majority of cold and flu-like illnesses) check out [this article](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1513/pats.201006-039RN). Some key excerpts are:
- “The most common way to ‘‘catch a cold’’ is to pick up a rhinovirus with the fingertip and introduce it into the eye or nose.”
- “It is possible to avoid catching a new cold by paying close attention to the hands. Not touching the eyes or nose with the fingers will decrease the risk of infection.”

Hence, this LPT. It’s based on the well documented phenomenon of self-inoculation. Washing one’s hands is still the gold standard. However, the vast majority of people are not washing their hands especially often. Conversely, people are constantly touching their faces, essentially subconsciously. Therefore, to reduce the risk of transmission/self-inoculation, stop touching your face (particularly around your eyes). 

The study ""Protective Effect of Hand-Washing and Good Hygienic Habits Against Seasonal Influenza: A Case-Control Study."" specifically concludes that ""infrequent touching [of] the eyes, nose, or mouth with ones hands"" led to a ""substantially lower risk of community-acquired influenza infection"" (frequent hand washing and getting the flu vaccine were also associated with substantially lower risk). 

In the article ""Medical myth busting: Separating fact from fiction about colds and flu"" from the Fred Hutch, Dr. Steve Pergam (member of the Vaccine an Infectious Disease Division there) says things like:
- ""To infect someone, these particles don’t have to be breathed in, they just have to get into any mucosal surface — eyes, mouth or nose. . . Stop touching your face!""
- ""Your hands touch elevator buttons, public transport rails, all the different places you go on a daily basis, then you touch your face hundreds of times a day. I have a bottle of hand gel with me at all times.  You can’t stop yourself all the time, but be more aware of whether your hands are clean before you start rubbing your eyes.""

A 1982 study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology titled ""TRANSMISSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RHINOVIRUS INFECTION BY CONTAMINATED SURFACES"" found that in a controlled setting, when healthy adults touched a surface contaminated with rhinovirus and then touched their face, up to 56% of them became infected. 

The 2015 study ""Survival of rhinoviruses on human fingers"" states ""person-to-person transmission is most likely due to the contamination of hands by the nasal secretions of the infected person passed to a susceptible individual, either directly to the fingers or via an environmental intermediary; infection then follows from self-inoculation to the upper nasal airways or eyes."" and subsequently cites four more studies as supporting evidence.

But my wife and I got in a car accident last year. I split my head open and got a concussion and got staples in my head. Head injuries bleed a lot, and my wife was smart enough to pull out her phone and snap a couple of gruesome pictures of me with blood sheeting down my face.

Fast forward to now, and my wife mentioned sort of off-hand to our lawyer that we had pictures from the scene. He immediately took them and sent them to the adjuster and today we got their new offer which had almost doubled the money we’d take home.

LifeProTips,"As the children of parents we have a very one way relationship. We see our parents as parents, not people. And for most of childhood that is essentially a service role - they do things for you, you take things from them.

I'm now in my 30s and I realized I only knew a few select moments in both of their lives before I existed. A couple of highlights, but nothing that really painted a picture about how they came to be the people they were as adults. 

So a couple of years ago I asked them both to write down their story for my birthday. Of course, this was a difficult request for them - getting me some socks or a couple of books feels way more comfortable. But I pushed them on it, helped manage their expectations and made it clear I wasn't expecting Ulysses, and stood firm on the request. 

One year later and my birthday comes around again and this time I got the presents I asked for. Instantly read them cover to cover (I mean, one was 4 pages typed up, and the other was a small handwritten book, so it didn't take too long for either of us), and they were so amazing. So much stuff I didn't know about them both. And not just events, but feelings, attitudes, perspectives, and insight into them both as people rather than just parents.

So this is my LPT to you. I am lucky enough to still have both of my parents, but quite a lot of my peers do not, and it really makes me appreciate that I still have the time to do this.

Replenishing? I said yup. He then laughs and said with a wave of his hand they're doing it all wrong. I started laughing and he said I guess you experienced it too. I said yup.

LifeProTips,"I read this somewhere online years ago and it has stuck with me. I love this tip because it is a simple way to make sure you can be helpful without being socially awkward! 

For example, if someone has a hair sticking sideways or food in their teeth (and in some circumstances, their clothes are on inside out, if there is a room they can change in nearby) if you tell them, generally no matter where they are, they can fix it easily and quickly. 

On the other hand, if you say “oh that (insert clothing item here) is too short or not flattering” or “you’ve got a huge pimple”, you are not being helpful. That is not easily fixed or changed and could cause the person to be insecure about their looks that day or they may overthink it. Also, if you think about some of the possibilities here, you might find it’s just your personal opinion on what you would wear, how you would do your hair/makeup etc. and you are being unkind rather than being helpful.

Hope this helps someone! :)

LifeProTips,"Once upon a time I had a collections agency turned on me for a false claim based on a closed account...
Having unsuccessfully tried repeatedly to resolve the issue with both the original company and the collections agency... I stopped talking to them. 

This resulted in a ratcheting up of harassment whereby the collection agent started calling my family, and eventually my work. Because i had originally tried in good faith to resolve the issue, I found this inexcusable.
After the third day in a row where the new agent repeatedly called me at work leaving her extension on my voicemail about an ""urgent business matter""if I didn't pick up, (i was external tech support at a company that manufactured proprietary data logging weather recording instruments), I'd had enough. Each time I had picked up I'd refused to identify myself, promptly told her not to call me anymore, and then hung up on her. She'd ignored that and persisted. On my way home, it came to me...

Every day for the next week, whenever I wasn't on a call, I'd call her...say ""stop calling me"" when she answered, and then hang up. After the fifth or sixth time, she started sending me straight to voicemail. You get 2 minutes...use your 2 minutes. Occasionally I read her articles from the newspaper, but mostly I just opined about what a terrible life she must've lived to wind up doing such scumbaggery for a living.

If you stop talking, it draws even more attention to you crying, and the other party may stop your discussion to ask if you’re alright or if you need to stop. If you keep talking and draw as little attention to it as possible, it keeps the conversation going and draws the attention away from you and back to the discussion.

LifeProTips,"This has worked for me on my last three jobs (one of them was a promotion) that I got. When the interviewer asks the question: what salary are you looking for?, instead of listing what you’re expecting ask them instead. 

I always start with explaining that I have been researching salaries in my field but wanted to know what they felt is a competitive salary for someone with my experience? (If this your first job interview or you’re going for an entry level job that you don’t have experience in, you can always change the part about experience to “this position”). 

Oftentimes, they will give you the number that they are expecting to pay for that position; and every time I ask a potential employer it has been at least $5-$10k more then I was going to ever say. 

This also helps you compare what they’re willing to pay vs whether that salary is worth the job. AND you don’t run the risk of under selling yourself! (If they’re expecting to pay $60k and you say $40k, they’re not going to correct you and also might think that you are not as qualified or have a high opinion of your own self worth).

Edit to add: a bunch of commenters are making valid points. Do your research, know your worth and what the worth of the position is. If the company lowballs you, ask for more if you feel comfortable. Salaries are often part of a negotiation, and if you know you deserve more then advocate for it. Prove to them that you’re worth the investment, because if they’re not willing to pay you what you deserve (provided they can AFFORD to do so, some businesses just don’t have the funds to meet the same pay as another business) then you have to consider if they’re worth your time. Does the money matter for you to accept the job, and if the answer is yes then get it!

LifeProTips,"Edit: Guys, please don’t blow up my DMs asking for recommendations. I’ve gotten a few hundred now and I don’t feel good about sending links to you all. This isn’t supposed to be an ad, this was supposed to be something you can use as a reference when researching a dash cam. I guarantee almost every dash cam with good ratings will be a good fit for you. Okay back to the post!

An old coworker told me an story about an accident that totaled his truck a while ago. He went through a greenlight, and a lady ran a red and t-boned him, totaling his truck. She paid off a witness at the bus stop and it was basically those two against his word. Fortunately, the bus was coming behind and caught the accident on it's cam. He tracked the bus down, and was able to get the footage from the bus and saved himself from jacked up premiums. 

Here's some advice on picking a dash cam, and towards the bottom there will be some helpful advice on installing a dash cam legally. You heard that, there's a legal and illegal way of installing a dash cam. I don't know everything there is to know about dash cams, but I'm sure at least a handful of people might benefit from this. If you don't have a dash cam, start looking for one after you're done reading.

**Picking a dash cam**

Here are some must have features when picking a dash cam: 

1. Find your price range- I'll be honest, right now isn't a great time to be spending money, but if you don't have a dash cam, you should seriously invest in one (when you can). That's right, this is an INVESTMENT. You're investing money into this in hopes that your insurance company won't jack your rates out the wazoo if you get in a car accident and the other driver pays off witnesses. There are some decent dash cams out there for $50, but I recommend spending at least $100 on one. I won't link or suggest a specific dash cam in order to protect the integrity of this post, but you get what you pay for, unless you get that $50-60 dash cam that I'm thinking of. There are some steals out there. Also, make sure that you get a good micro SD card as well. You can pick one up from Best Buy for less than $10. 

2. Automatic overlapping- Make sure it has ""loop"" recording so that it'll automatically replace old videos. If you have this, you'll just install it and it'll pretty much take care of itself until it breaks down, but checking to make sure that it's recording every time you put on your seatbelt isn't a bad idea (just do a quick glance at it to check that it's actively recording- usually indicates by a blinking red dot). Odds are, if you have loop recording, you'll have the ability to lock a video so it doesn't get overwritten as the card gets full. 

3. Automatic recording- Another must have for a dash cam is automatic on and off. Dash cams will usually plug into your cigarette lighter and most will turn on and off automatically based on whether the key is in the on/ off position. Don't get some cheapo one where you'll have to manually press a button to turn it on every time you get in your car... This is the equivalent of getting a major in Art History and a minor in computer science. 

4. Camera quality- Make sure that your dash cam has a reasonably clear camera. With dash cams, if you're able to make out the make and model of another car, you're good to go. As long as it's better than a gas station security camera, you're good to go for the most part. Unless you're able to shell out for something upwards of $150, then it probably won't be able to read the license plate of the car in front of you. I usually aim for 1080p or above just so that it'll look less like a pixelated mess on a computer screen in the event that you need to send the footage to somebody. You can always try to say enhance like they do on TV and watch as it magically unpixelates itself, but this has a lower chance of occurring than an entrepreneur major in college landing that sweet 6-digit salary job. 

5. Night time recording- This goes along with number 4, but don't buy a dash cam that suffers from astigmatism and can't record anything at night. With your headlights on, it'll blind the dash cam and everything that's seen in the light will just be washed out due to the contrast in light. Watch dash cam footage from both day and night. Amazon usually has users footage from that specific dash cam. Be the judge and decide whether or not you're okay with the quality, and if the footage is useful. If you're a cameraphile/ videophile, can you pretty please drop a comment describing what to look for in regards of camera specs?

6. Audio recording- What? You'll only capture your three-year-old screaming at the top of their lungs for more goldfish crackers. Wrong. This feature can be completely useful or utterly useless. If it records audio, then it's gonna be up to YOU to use it if you get into a vehicular incident. If you're able to read off the license plate of the car that swiped you, cut you off, and ran for it, then this will be valuable for tracking it down and confirming the identity of the driver if it comes to that. Like I said, most dash cams will have a tough time capturing license plates, but if you're able to read of the license plate of a car, you’ll have an easy time identifying the car and driver that ran off.

These are just the ""must haves"" for me. If I'm missing anything that you feel is a must, then feel free to mention it below and I'll edit it in later. Here are some features that aren't necessary, but can definitely be nice to have. You can skip this section and go down to the next one

1. Temperature resistance- If you live somewhere sunny, this is a must for you. The inside of your car get hotter than Satan's asscrack on a sunny day, and you'll want a camera that can hold up against that temperature, so check what it's rated for. Edit, u/mattisstillhere mentioned dash cams with super capacitors. These super capacitors are able to hold onto electricity for a longer period of time, and do a lot better in hot conditions, so check these out if you live somewhere with a lot of sun.

2. Gravity sensor- This is just a sensor that looks for a sudden change in g-force. Cameras that have these advertised usually come with a lithium battery that can begin recording if it feels a sudden jolt while the car's off. I've personally never been able to validate this feature, so take this one with a grain of salt.

3. Wide angle view- A wide angle will capture more information at the cost of detail. Honestly this is more of a preference. I'd personally recommend a wide angle just because it'll capture more of what you’re seeing as opposed to just capturing what's directly in front of the lens. 

4. GPS/ Speed logger- Mine definitely doesn't have this feature. You'll only see it in higher end dash cams that cost upwards of $150. This might be useful if you're trying to prove that you weren't speeding, but once again, take this feature with a grain of salt. Save your money and be reasonable when picking a dash cam. Don't be that elitist that brags about their $350 dash cam. 

5. WiFi Data Transfer- Some dash cams advertise this feature. What it does is it allows you to connect your phone to the dash cam and be able to load videos on your phone with it. I've had little success with mine, but if you have fast cellular data, this might be useful during a police report (hopefully you won't ever have an accident that's serious enough for a police report), but once again, this feature has proved gimmicky for me, and transferring video files can take a few long minutes. 

6. 10ft cable- My dash cam came with a 10ft cable that's made the dash look a lot nicer. Most dash cams use a micro-usb cable, so it wouldn't be too hard to find a cable this size, but it's nice if your dash cam came with one. Use it correctly, more on that below. 

7. Rearview/ passenger cam- Some dash cams have cameras in both the front and the rear. This is definitely another useless feature unless you're a rideshare driver/ have an extremely clear view of the rear and happen to get rear ended. Even then, if you get rear ended, a regular dash cam and damage to your vehicle will be more than enough prove that you were stopped. 

**Advice for installing and using a Dash Cam**

I'm kind of happy that you've made it this far. Typing something other than college essays has been fun. I get to use my voice and type informally. I hope I've made this dull topic a little bit more fun to read. Honestly if I read my own post, I would've clicked out 500 words ago, so thank you for sticking around. I hope you install decide to install a dash cam if you haven't already. 

1. Read the manual and learn the buttons and what they do. Seriously, read the manuals for everything, your car, your fridge, everything. They all have valuable information that make using the product a lot easier and more intuitive. 

2. In some states, it's illegal for your dash cam (or anything for that matter) to be obstructing your view of the road. Make sure that the spot that you mount your dash cam is compliant with local laws. Don't let the other insurance company sucker punch you and use this as a reason to not pay out your claim.

3. If your dash cam came with an extra long cable, use it. Loop it around the passenger side of the vehicle and gently push it between where the windshield meets the roofliner, and run it under your glovebox. Use some clear tape or adhesive clips to (discreetly) secure it to your windshield. 

4. Buy a high quality micro SD card. I recommend the ones that are advertised as ""high endurance"", as these are meant to withstand the constant recording and deleting of large files. The size of the micro SD card doesn't really matter, but a 32GB once is what I recommend. It should hold about 2 hours (don't quote me on this) worth of video at 1080p. If you get in a wreck, your micro SD card will have the footage on it, and you can upload it into a computer to save that footage.

5. If you get into a car accident and you know you're at fault, you're not legally obligated to give footage to the other driver or a cop unless there's probable cause that you committed a crime, or if they have a search warrant. Once again, I’m writing this post from the US so check your country’s laws.

Edit: Added spacing for a few walls of text. Fixed some grammar stuff too. 

I hope you won't ever need to use the dash cam, but 77% of drivers will be in an accident during their lifetime. That's the majority of us, and the average driver will be involved in 3 to 4 accidents in their life. Get a dash cam. Cover your butt and capture other drivers doing stupid things. Make an idiot driver compilation. Hopefully you aren't driving anywhere non-essential during these times, but if you are, take care and be careful.

LifeProTips,"Hi!

So when i was 10 years old (13 now) my dad passed away of a stroke.

It was a rough 3 weeks and school was a total mess. I finished my year (year 6) and we decided to move to another city. So during year 7 I was still pretty messed up. My grades went from pretty good to really bad. I finished the year with 18 pts (pretty bad-ish for Switzerland) the next school year is a big year academically. You need to get 20 pts to get into VP (Voie Prégymnasiale) basically sends you automatically to college/HS (idk lol) once you finish 11th grade. 

Anyways I realized that nothing that I ever did or say would bring my father back. So after grieving for what seemed like and eternity I decided to make him proud instead of failing.

Here’s how I did it.

After my worst year in school ever I went back in and started to put in some effort. I paid attention, I studied hard at home. When exams where approaching I studied like never before. (4+ hours every day) I got very good results from this. Finished the year with 21 /24 pts and got into VP.

I also had to deal with a new school and I had to try and make new friends which was not easy.

In summary:

In the beginning it will hurt. A lot. But overtime you will learn that it’s more important to shoot for the sky’s rather than fall to the ground. I kept my motivation and dignity to help myself and make my father proud.

In the end it paid off.


Edit: Wow! I did NOT expect that to do so well. Words could not express how grateful I am to see the response in general let alone the awards. I’ll try my best to respond to all of you but no promises. Thank you so much.

Edit 2: so apparently my message didn’t really come across the full way. Yes a dead person can not feel pride, my point is:

Make yourself proud and do what you think is best for you and do what you *think* would make a deceased loved one proud. This (in my case) worked for me but every person has their different way of grieving and their different way of going about things going forward. Also try your best to pull yourself up no matter how hard life throws you down. I know some people just can’t because of their own guilt or sorrow but at least try.

If you fail I wish you can one day succeed in all of your endeavors and dreams.

Oh and to all of you people that live to downvote comments that make me feel *actually* better

LifeProTips,"This happened to me many years ago but I was reminded of it by something else. At my father's funeral, a lot of people said they didn't know he had a daughter. Not terribly surprising; we were adults and he had moved to a different city, I was from his first marriage, and he wasn't terribly sociable so their social life revolved around his second wife, who didn't know me well. But it was still very invalidating and hurtful in that situation.

LifeProTips,"Seeing lots of dogs walking off leash in public parks now that dedicated dog areas are locked up during the lockdown. Some look like new owners with new puppies.

Not everyone likes dogs. Some are allergic. Some are deathly scared. Dogs can also react to sudden unexpected movements in surprising ways. Even if you lose your grip on a leash, it's easier to catch a leash than the unleashed dog. 

Keep your dog on a leash at all times in public. For everyone's safety, including your and other dogs.

Edit: lots of great comments below. Some awful stories about off leash dogs. Wanted to address a few points that have come up in the discussion:

For those confident in their dog's training, a leash is most likely to save your dog's life, not anyone else's. Your dog is more predictable to you but you have no idea how other dogs or people will react. With a leash you can get them out of any dangerous situation.

A leash is not a replacement for training or socialization, it's more like a safety. Train and socialize your dog. And that never stops. If your dog can't walk on a loose leash it's because it wasn't trained to do so.

Exercise for high energy breeds. There's a reason high energy breeds are only recommended for people with high energy lifestyle people. Use 30ft or 50ft leads to train recall. Train your dog to run along side you. Go out to remote hiking trails. Running around in your local public park isn't nearly enough.

And retractable leashes are terrible. They teach the dog to pull, and you can get some nasty injuries if they get caught in your dog or your leg.",37863,LPT: Keep your dog leashed in public at all times no matter how well trained you think he/she is.,0.79,1590222545.0,gp1gnv,t3_gp1gnv,3600,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/gp1gnv/lpt_keep_your_dog_leashed_in_public_at_all_times/,7,jucromesti

Edit 1:
Here are a few methods to reverse image search. I'm sure there are more.

Desktop:

* Right-click an image & select ""Search Google for this image"" (maybe this only words in certain browsers, not entirely sure)

* Or you can use [images.google.com](http://www.images.google.com) & click the camera icon to upload a pic or paste the URL of the image


Mobile:

* Use Chrome and hold down on an image & select ""Search Google for This Image""
* Use the Google app & open Google Lens
* Use [tineye.com](http://www.tineye.com)

Edit 2: Added the current prices for that lamp since prices will change in the future.

Also a couple more notes:

* Some commenters let me know this practice is called ""white labeling."" I'm assuming it's legal because the suppliers agree for Wayfair to do it when they agree to sell on Wayfair.

* This doesn't always work; sometimes Wayfair has it cheapest. So you can also try this tip the opposite way if you're about to buy something at Target/Home Depot/Macy's/etc, you can reverse image search to see if Wayfair has it cheaper under a fake name.

* Wayfair creates their own photos/renderings sometimes, so you may need to try a few photos.

* Since Wayfair, Joss & Main, AllModern, & Birch Lane are all owned by the same company, they often offer the same product on multiple sites with different prices. Sometimes the names are the same, sometimes different. So be sure to check their other sites too before purchasing.

    For example, this 5' x 8' rug is on all four sister sites:

LifeProTips,"Your priority should be to help them process how they're feeling, then you can tackle the problem later. So instead of immediately offering solutions, try acknowledging the person's feelings and the legitimacy of the problem they're facing.

For example, instead of...

* ""Why don't you try to do...""
* ""What have you done to fix it?""
* ""How can I make it better?""

Try using...

* ""Wow, that does sound really tough.""
* ""I can't imagine how hard that must be for you.""
* ""I would absolutely feel sad/angry/frustrated too...""

If you're not sure what someone needs, asking can be as simple as ""That sounds really tough. Is there anything I can do to help or do you just want to talk about it?""

LifeProTips,"Taught this to my sister last year.

She just came to me and told me about how her AP English teacher tried to pull a fast one on the entire class.

&#x200B;

I've had it happen to me before as well in my bachelors.

&#x200B;

Teacher changes the syllabus to either add new rules or claim there was leniancy options that students didn't take advantage of. Most of the time it's harmless but sometimes it's catastrophic to people's grades.

&#x200B;

In my case, teacher tried to act like there was a requirement people weren't meeting for their reports. Which was not in the original syllabus upload.

&#x200B;

In my sister's case, the english teacher was giving nobody more than an 80% on their weekly essays. So when a bunch of students complained and brought their parents, he modified the syllabus to act like he always gave them the option to come in after school and re-write the essays but they never took advantage of it. One of my sister's friends was crying because her mom, a teacher at that school, was mad at her for not going in for the make-up after school.

When confronted about this not being in the original syllabus, he acted like it was always there. My sister of course had the original copy downloaded and handled it like a boss! Now people get to make up their missed points and backdate it.

&#x200B;

Sorry to all good teachers out there but not all teachers are as ethical as we'd like to think.

&#x200B;

Edit:

AP English is in high school, it's an advanced placement class equivalent to a college credit. Difficult but most students in there are hard working.

&#x200B;

Final Edit:

The goal of doing this is not to catch a teacher in their lie, the reasons to make a folder dedicated for a class from day 1 and keeping copies of everything locally are too many to list, they include taking ownership, having records, making it easy for yourself, learning to be organized, having external organization, overcoming lack of organization in an LMS, helping you study offline, reducing steps needed to access something, annotating PDFs, and many more.

A very simple example would be a service like meals on wheels, it can be as easy as picking up food and dropping it off to someone that needs it.  If you don't have a car they also need help prepping food.  Their info is readily available online.

LifeProTips,"I lost my wife a few weeks ago and received a whole lot of support messages. This may be a bit subjective, but seeing how I felt about most of these, and what I am going through since, I now know what I will and won't do when something similar happens to someone I know, so I wanted to share:

The first contact, right after you get the news, is important because it shows you care, but don't try to find the right words, or worse, don't state that there is no words that can ease their pain. This is obvious, and you are the 1000th one to say that. They know. They just need to know you're there.

Do not, in any case, state that if they need anything, they can call you. Yes, I need to talk to someone after the kids are asleep, I need the hedge trimmed, I need someone to look after the kids on Thursday, I need a second income to keep paying my bills, I need a friend with benefit to compensate for my brutal lack of physical interactions. Don't make them draw the line between what's reasonable and what's not. Don't make them chose who to call among the fifty people that were this vague in case they actually have a need they find reasonable.  If you think you can bring something specific, be specific. They need to know you are the one to call in this specific situation.

If the specific thing you have to offer is just to be available for a phone call when they need someone to talk to, then it is not enough to say it. One hundred people told me that I can call them whenever I need to talk, some of them specified ""even in the middle of the night"". It may be just me, but when I am trying to go on with my life and receive calls from different persons a couple of times a day, then I feel less alone. If I get nothing for a couple of days, then this situation is really depressing, and having a list of a hundred people I can interrupt in their daily lives to suck some comfort off, does not help at all. So just call them from time to time, weeks and even months after the fact. Show you think about them, don't make them call you out of despair.

&#x200B;

EDIT: before I go to bed, I just want to clarify a couple of things that induce misunderstandings that keep coming to my mailbox:

This is not a rant. I do not resent people that did the things I listed. As I stated in my first paragraph, I experienced the effect they had on me, I think I have learned things from this, I would like to share. I thought I was clear about this, but every support message I got was comforting. Some were just much more useful than others. 

The ""Do not, in any case"" intro is clearly horribly worded. Yes. My bad. What I mean is, when you say something so vague, it doesn't have any more effect than a simple ""sorry for your loss"". If you are genuinely willing to help, then this does not bring the message across.

The FWB part. Ok, I was illustrating how ""anything"" is completely useless in this context, because you make the person draw his own line between what is reasonable and what is not. To illustrate how this line was completely subjective, I gave several examples to illustrate the fact that you had to draw a line somewhere. Starting from something completely reasonable, finishing with something I thought everybody would consider unreasonable in this context. Three of these five examples are completely made up.

Now it's [non-denominational winter holiday] and while everyone else is scrambling for a present, I can rest easy because I can just consult the list and get everyone something that they will both love and never see coming.

I look at the title and author, take a picture, and add it to the list. She also really likes jigsaw puzzles. Once I noticed that I added it to the list. For her last birthday I was looking through the list to see if I could think of anything and I decided to get her a custom jigsaw puzzle of this one painting that she loved and has since never seen again. She was stoked when she opened it and it's been her favorite puzzle since (even after the breakup).

LifeProTips,"I just got this email today and even knowing it seemed phishy, I couldn’t help but panic. The subject line included my username and a password that I have (stupidly) been using on various unimportant websites since I was a teenager. The email was looong and written using those weird characters spam emails often use, but it was fairly well written grammatically. 

Essentially, I was told that this person (or human equivalent of decades old pond scum) had managed to gain access to my phone, had recorded me, and unless I paid it $1900 was going to send that recording to all of my contacts on messenger, Facebook, and email. It said I had a certain amount of time to pay up, and that even if I went to the police there was no way the email could be traced. It even went so far as to say there was a specific pixel in the email showing that I had read it. 

Thankfully my boyfriend was with me and quick to notice it had to be a scam since I don’t even have Facebook. He was immediately able to find an [article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2019/02/sextortion-bitcoin-scam-makes-unwelcome-return/amp/) online to confirm that this “sextortion” scam has been going on for the past couple years. The wording of my own little special delivery of an email was almost verbatim the wording of the email in the article. 

As someone who has always considered myself fairly savvy to recognizing a scam, I have to say this one really got to me. Even knowing it’s a scam, I still can’t help but feel violated.

LifeProTips,"**Edit:** Don't forget to sanitize the tablet before you ship it!

Howdy!

We did this for my 96 year old grandmother, since we haven't been able to visit her.  We had to come up with a solution that would work for her, even though she's not in a position to learn any technology at the moment.

I bought an inexpensive tablet with a cellular internet connection from Verizon, and set it up so that it would automatically accept video calls over Skype from me and the rest of my family (the Skype app has a setting for that). Then I sanitized it, and dropped it off for her.

When we call, we're immediately connected. My grandmother doesn't need to tap or touch anything to answer the call. She just needs to keep the tablet plugged into its charger in a place where she can hear our voices when we call.

There was also no need to set the tablet up on WiFi, since it uses a cellular connection. For her, it worked ""out of the box.""  The tablet's cellular connection only costs us $10/month extra on our existing phone family plan.

My grandmother has really enjoyed it. 🙂

If anyone here wants to set up a tablet like this for a friend or relative, I've written up [some detailed instructions](https://tabletconnect.org/) explaining how to do it.

Feel free to ask me questions here. You can also DM me if you run into any trouble. I'm happy to help however I can!

LifeProTips,"I was a submariner for 6 years with multiple deployments of 6 months and other extended underways of multiple months with short in-port stints in between. In that time I had to develop coping strategies for dealing with the isolation and loss of social contact with the outside World.

Here's what I learned:

1) Hold fast to whatever is waiting for you on the other side. It doesn't matter it feels foolish, or whether there is certainty of it happening exactly as you plan in the end. Hope can deliver us from the darkest of days.

2) Be goofy AF. Crack jokes. Be odd. Let your mind wander when it needs to. You need to let that pent up energy out often. Channel it into whatever creative nonsense you can think of.

3) Food is fuel. Eat what you need, but ration the good stuff. You'll need the good rewarding pick-me-ups spaced out in time.

4) Make a time-keeping record / log. Put all your thoughts, poems, songs, rants, etc in it. Bonus if you can collaborate on it with others.

5) Share your thoughts with others and commiserate often. We are all in the suck, and it doesn't matter how much worse anyone has it. Your feelings are valid, and need acknowledgement.

6) Write letters to loved ones, and record videos for them to watch (and facetime now that that tech is available). I always felt special when someone went to the trouble of making something like that for me, and letting me know they care. And I felt good making them too.

7) Have a project. Something long term that you have to work on gradually. Education, making, hobby, art, etc.

8) Make and share playlists for your various moods, and embrace the moods you feel fully. Get all the joy, rage, pain, and everything out. Scream if you need to. Don't worry about looking crazy, because the World is crazy, and we are a reflection of it.

9) Get to know people that you would never talk to in your normal routine. They will change your life.

10) Reward your accomplishments. Because you are a survivor, thrill hunter, a champion, and a badass.

11) Be a dick as little as possible, and share whatever you can.",33120,LPT Advice on managing extended periods away from the World,0.93,1584617812.0,fl8lms,t3_fl8lms,793,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/fl8lms/lpt_advice_on_managing_extended_periods_away_from/,24,Slartibradfast

TL:DR; when you’re a bystander in a victim/harasser conflict, a good way to de escalate and show support is to engage in friendly conversation with the victim. Especially if you aren’t comfortable engaging the aggressor. 

At the checkout line, the cashier was a little inexperienced and was having trouble with her machine. As she waited for help I smiled at her and patiently waited, noticing that she was becoming more flustered as people began queuing behind me. An older gentleman put his groceries on the belt and began to complain loudly and rudely about how long this was taking. I don’t normally think of a good way to approach awkward social situations but something in my brain clicked that day. As she became more uncomfortable and flustered I shifted slightly between them and began complimenting the cashier’s curly hair (mine is naturally curly as well and it can be a pain). I kept her engaged in conversation until a manager arrived and fixed her computer.  You don’t have to engage the harasser to show someone you have their back.

Edit; For those in the comments saying I should have called the guy out; I am 5 feet tall and somewhat introverted. Confronting this person for his rude behavior was not something I could have handled well.  I do not trust people to not be violent and I preferred not to draw any attention to myself.

LifeProTips,"Since quarantine threw off my gym schedule, I went on a hunt to find a workout and [wait for all this to blow over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiKx8lOEktQ). To my surprise, [archive.org](https://archive.org) of all places had the entirety of P90X, for streaming and download. Now I can get a 12 pack in the comfort of my own home. 

You can find the entire OG Tony Horton P90X [here](https://archive.org/details/P90XNutritionGuide_201702).

Stay safe and healthy everyone :)

Edit 1: For those having trouble accessing the link above, just Google “P90X archive.org”. If you use Bing, navigate to google.com and search for “P90X archive.org”.

Edit 2: [Insanity](https://archive.org/details/08MaxIntervalCircuit_201509), the more cardio oriented one, is on archive.org too, as well as the shorter [P90X3](https://archive.org/details/accelerator_202003).

Edit 3: For everyone asking if this is hard - yes, it will kick your ass. It will grind you down, especially if you’ve never worked out before and try to keep up with Tony and his gang. 

BUT the beauty of P90X is that it allows you to go at your own pace. Modify the exercises. Do half the reps. Whatever it is that you do, just maintain consistency and don’t hurt yourself. It always gets easier.

Once the quarantine eases up, I hope to see you all come out of your home cocoons as jacked butterflies 🦋

LifeProTips,"This is a sweeping generalization so while it applies to most situations, obviously if you click on something with 90% 1-star ratings it's not going to apply.

5-star reviews are often obtained by the company prompting or rewarding the customer for feedback, and since they have nothing to complain about, they just hit the button. They may not reflect an actual exemplary product.

1-star reviews are often the result of a mistake or incident that's not common overall. If you try reading these you'll be flooded with complaints about shipping cost, an accident caused by the individual who packed their order, or some other random occurrence that is extremely unlikely to happen to you. Very little product information.

3-stars often reflect the people who got what they wanted without any real incidents, but found the product to be lacking in some way.

Being physically separate and not letting up when the puppy claws at the door or whines will help it cope with being apart from you/alone.


Reposting because it got deleted for lack of adding a flair, my bad

EDIT: I have tried to respond to those asking for further advice and hope I didn’t miss anyone. That being said, I am not a vet, I don’t know your pets history, and therefore the best bet for you and your dog is to reach out to them regarding any advice or further information. Veterinarians are not just there for medical advice; they work with animals every single day and can have some seriously helpful advice, and most of the time it’s free of charge if you are already in the office for a checkup or speaking over the phone/email.

This post was intended to curb what will likely be a massive change in you and your puppies daily routine because of the outbreak. There will be yet another massive change when you go back to your old routine, perhaps back to work on a daily basis, and it’s important to consider all the affects this could have on your puppy and their progress.
I also recommend playing brain games with your dog during isolation, and also in general— look them up, they’re fun and rewarding. My dog likes hide and seek and anything involving treat rewards haha. 
Most vets (and commenters here) also recommend crate training. This is of course ideal, and better than going to another room and letting your dog claw at the door, but right now not everyone has access to a crate so just use best judgement and speak to your vet when possible.

I used to be disorganized and messy but simply adhering to a principle of picking up two things every time I enter a room has completely changed me.

This taught me a valuable lesson that being clean is not about waiting until everything gets messy to clean it, its about living a clean lifestyle. I now understand how clean people are clean, they simply are literally always cleaning. The best way to be clean and organized is to incorporate cleaning into your lifestyle. There's no need to take time away from your day to clean simply adhere to this rule and you will quickly see how easy it is to incorporate cleaning into your daily lifestyle.

Enter my room, pick up two pieces of clothes. Enter my kitchen, put away a couple dry dishes. Leave my car and take two pieces of trash with me. No overwhelming three hour cleans just an incredibly simple and easy commitment. I don't even think about it anymore.

LifeProTips,"I have a very small life tip that is not epic but will certainly come in handy!

I was told when I was younger (and unfortunately cannot remember where) to always carry a pack of playing cards wherever I went - that I would never know when I might need them. They are cheap and they dont take up much space so whenever I change bags or backpacks I always ensure there is a pack of cards in there somewhere. I cannot tell you how often they have been useful!

If you end up stuck somewhere unexpected for an extended period of time, a pack of cards is a great way to keep everyone occupied and happy and make the time go quickly. The options for games are limitless! You will also be thought of favourably as the prudent one for having the cards with you in the first place!

This can also be great as an ice breaker if you are with people you dont really know but are stuck with through circumstance. Additionally if there are any worries or anxieties in the room eg. power cut or locked in somewhere for example, playing cards can take a lot of people's minds off of their unease and lift the tension.

Have a bored child on a train or waiting room with no toys? A pack of cards to a child can literally be hours of entertainment, you can practice numbers, magic, play snap, build card houses...

My husband is in the military and also swears by this tip - they take cards with them everywhere as you never know when you may have to wait around for hours and need something to do to keep boredom at bay.

One final tip I would say that make sure you know a few basic card games you could simply explain to others if needed to get things going but one of the good things about this would be if you do get stuck somewhere and have hours to kill with a colleague/friend/stranger, you also have the means to learn games from them and get talking etc! 

I know this is not going to go changing lives but hopefully may be helpful to someone :-)

This was just a small tip that I didnt think would get noticed in amongst the awesome posts on this sub so I just wanted to say..  Thank You SO MUCH!

LifeProTips,"Many conflicts can be nipped in the bud by changing the form of communication. The most obvious example is switching from written communication to paying a visit (or calling on the phone), or the other way around: leaving a conversation that doesn't lead anywhere and instead write a text message or an e-mail where you explain your position.

1. The pause gives you (and the counterpart) a chance to calm down, in case either of you is worked up.
2. It might give you a new approach to whatever the difference of opinion is about, since the new form of communication demands that you rethink it.
3. When writing emails/texting, many people accidentally come across as either blunt or sarcastic (especially if there's a difference of opinion going on). If that's how you interpret the other person, speaking to them might dispel your concerns.

LifeProTips,"My significant other gave me some flowers for Valentine's Day. Turns out there were lilies in the bouqet and my cat ate some of the leaves. We had to rush my cat to the emergency vet, where he will be hooked up to an IV for 3 days. It's unknown if he will survive and the vet told me that it's very serious. On the offchance that he does survive, there will likely be permanent kidney damage. My cat has been by my side since I was a kid and I can't imagine losing my little buddy.

Since today is Valentine's Day, and Easter is coming up soon... Please be aware that **LILIES ARE POISONOUS TO CATS**. Even just breathing in the pollen can result in death.

""The entire lily plant is toxic: the stem, leaves, flowers, pollen, and even the water in a vase. Eating just a small amount of a leaf or flower petal, licking a few pollen grains off its fur while grooming, or drinking the water from the vase can cause your cat to develop fatal kidney failure in less than 3 days. The toxin, which only affects cats, has not been identified. Dogs that eat lilies may have minor stomach upset but they don’t develop kidney failure.""

**Here are the most toxic variety of lilies:**
- Asiatic lily (including hybrids)
- Daylily
- Easter lily
- Japanese Show lily
- Oriental lily
- Rubrum lily
- Stargazer lily
- Wood lily

LifeProTips,"Experts are extremely picky people, in *any* field, and chances are, if you don't know a lot about something, you won't understand the subtleties of, say, what kind of equipment is high-quality, or what kind of stuff would really be useful to someone who takes it seriously.

I've seen this happen before tons of times—well-meaning friends and relatives want to buy something for you, but since they don't quite understand, they end up getting you something that's essentially useless. And while you're incredibly grateful for the gesture, especially if a lot of money was spent, it's just uncomfortable, and it's a situation that could've been avoided had they taken the extra step to talk to you or a professional to see what kind of stuff would really be useful.

Of course, this often relates to money. Say your niece is a serious trumpet player and plays in a conservatory. You want to go all out, and decide to buy her a trumpet. You see that the highest-rated trumpets cost thousands of dollars, which of course you can't afford, so you end up buying her one for about $100. Definitely a kind gesture! And of course, no one's suggesting you should've bankrupted yourself to buy the professional model! But the trumpet you've bought her is essentially a toy that's actually useless to her at her level. Whereas if you'd spoken to her or a real trumpet player, you could've instead bought her a $50 professional mouthpiece, or a new edition of a book of études she's been wanting to play, which would have saved you money and served her for years.

EDIT: I don't know if it's worth replying to these comments, but no, this doesn't make you ungrateful. Obviously, when you're given a gift like in the example, you're going to show your full appreciation, since this person went out of their way to get you a thoughtful gift and may have spent a lot of money. In no situation should the receiver complain or criticize. But if you're a gift giver and want to give something the person will actually enjoy, follow this advice. As a kid, when I only had an Xbox 360, but my aunt gave me Oblivion for the PS3 (i.e., a game that I could not play no matter what, since it wouldn't run on my console), of course I thanked her profusely, but I'm not a bad person for having wished that she'd done a bit more research and spent her money on something I could use.

LifeProTips,"Speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. In fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. It's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. However, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.

The way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. The first game: play as normal and see who wins. You normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. There's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.

Second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. Suddenly, the room fell quiet. Each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. There was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.

This was then explained in the context of doing PowerPoint presentations. We have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. Turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. When the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.

Whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.

**Obligatory clarification edits:**

1. This is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. Don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this.
2. The key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. They must be aware that it is wrong.
3. Don't do this in a real, practical situation. This is a learning and training tip.",28193,"LPT: If you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible",0.9,1573371669.0,du8l6b,t3_du8l6b,461,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/du8l6b/lpt_if_you_want_to_make_sure_someone_has_learned/,2,nusensei

LifeProTips,"I spent years working in Afghanistan, and have been in some form of lockdown (curfew, limited movement, etc) for extended periods of time while living in a tense situation. **This is what I learned from my mistakes:**

**Work out every day.** You go into this like a prison sentence thinking you’ll have a six-pack by the time they lift the quarantine, but the stress of your remote work, caring for others etc doesn’t leave you the free time you thought it would. You are exhausted and stressed out. When you don’t get exercise, you stop being able to manage stress, you stop being able to sleep well, and there is nothing like insomnia to make you unravel. If you hate it, aim for 10 minutes. If you stop sleeping, know that exercise is the fastest way to reverse that.

**Socialize as much as possible.** Obviously from a safe distance or online, but it's so easy to fall into a pattern of work and TV, binging news, and self-isolation. Sharing your experience with others, talk, and human contact are critical. If you live with someone, (and therefore not practicing social distancing) make sure to hug them as much as possible. If you live alone, hug yourself, give yourself little massages, take long baths. We are tactile creatures and a lack of human contact can cause depression, stress, and poor health overall. Lack of touch can also exacerbate anxiety disorders and various mood disorders.

**Disconnect from the scary thing, and laugh as much as possible**: So easy to while away your days on twitter and news feeds trying to keep track of what’s going on. Terrible for mental health. Check in on that as needed, and then tear yourself away and feed your brain with books, and conversations with others, movies, and TV, online classes etc. Take advantage of all the stuff that is being made freely available, learn a skill whatever. Most of all, laugh. Watch comedies, read funny books, appreciate the ironies of the situations you’ll inevitably encounter, write them down. Laughter releases endorphins, promoting well-being and relieving stress. Ideally, laugh with others.

**Help someone:** It makes you feel useful in a time when it's hard to feel useful. It's easy to question the point of your work when \*that\* is happening outside. Guaranteed there is someone nearby, literally and figuratively, who needs help. Put up a few signs offering to help those who need groceries or medicines, offer to walk dogs. Adopt a pet short term before the inevitable closure of shelters. Call family members, let stressed-out friends vent to you, be a safe space. If you have extra money, give it to someone who doesn’t. There are a million ways to help, and every one of them will make you and someone else feel better.

**Check in on your own mental health:** It’s easy to think you’re fine, mental health issues often emerge like the boiling frog fable. Stop, take a minute and ask yourself how you’re doing. Ask for help when you need it, and know that lots of mental health support services are available online, including therapy over skype/zoom.

Edit: by "" Adopt a pet short term "" I meant fostering! As several people have pointed out "" better to be a foster failure (fosters who adopt the animal) than having to return an animal because you can't really care for it when you go back to work. ""

LifeProTips,"For example, if a friend gives you a piece of advice and your first reaction is to explain why that advice won't work for you, then you're missing out on a chance to improve. You should instead stop and consider what they said. While in some cases you will still disagree, honest reflection and contemplation can open your mind up to positive change.

- One roll of toilet paper for each bathroom
- One pot (can be used to boil water as well as prepare food)
- One pan
- Corkscrew and/or bottle opener
- Can opener
- What you need to make coffee in the morning, you can get by usually with good instant or a Melitta-style cone to make pour-over coffee into whatever.
- A sharp knife for food prep
- A pair of scissors (more that one if you use bins secured with zip ties)
- One box-cutter per person who will unpack (if you use regular boxes)
- Phone charger
- Trash bags
- Shower curtain and rings (unless it's really skanky, otherwise, you can throw it away as soon as you get a new one, remember you would be showering the next day with it anyway)


Optional:

- If you're eco-conscious, a plate, bowl, water glass, mug, and place-setting per person
- Trash can
- Curtains and a tension rod for the bedroom if there are no window treatments.
- A fan if you are going somewhere in the summer and the AC needs to be set-up
- Two screwdrivers, flat and Philips head, duct tape, and WD-40

LifeProTips,"Lifelong introvert here, who has always struggled with social anxiety and striking up conversations with new people, even though I know it is good for my personal growth.

In the last few years, my ability to engage with strangers has dramatically started to improve due to an unexpected influence - marketing books.  The more books I read by guys like Seth Godin or Donald Miller, the more I started focusing on other people and trying to understand them and how I can be valuable to them and make their day a little better.  This hasn't brought me any huge financial success, but it HAS significantly improved my ability to chat with strangers.

My guess is because trying to drum up the ""courage"" to go talk to a stranger is by default putting them in a somewhat adversarial position.  The question ""What if they don't like me?"" I used to always agonize over is very inwardly focused, defensive and egotistical.

Instead, when I started focusing more on bringing value to that other person in some small way, the mission of increasing net happiness on the planet helped me break away from my need to be ""liked"" at least for a few moments at a time - long enough to break the ice in new conversations and discover 9 times out of 10 that the other person has zero negative opinion about you whatsoever.  Their opinion is pretty much based on the value you bring and the amount of empathy you can express.

That's all.  Just a word of encouragement.  Best of luck!

EDIT: Wow, thank you everyone, so, so much!  The outpouring of responses over the weekend has been really encouraging.  I'm glad I could make a few people's day better!   Some asked about book specifics, so here are some of my tops.  Again, these are mostly marketing books, not prescriptive for social anxiety per se.  But they each helped me in different way to look through other people's eyes:

1. ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer
2. ""Never Split the Difference"" by Chris Voss
3. ""Tribes"" by Seth Godin

If you find yourself in a situation where you are helping someone who needs medical attention and you cannot call 911 yourself (and there are other people around you), try not to yell ‘Someone call 911!’ Everyone might be expecting someone else to call, leading to 911 never getting called.

LifeProTips,"I'm always amazed how many people simply don't ask questions about others and just continue talking about themselves unless they are stopped.

We all like the feeling of the endorphin rush we get from talking about our passions and interests, but after a certain amount of time, if you never ask me how I'm doing or what I've been up to, talking with you just becomes an effort. It's not a conversation anymore, it's a duty to listen with no hope of reciprocation.

What makes a conversation enjoyable is when someone tells you a story or something from their life, not because they just want to hear themselves talk, but because they want to hear your opinion on what they've said and give you the chance to respond, or maybe share a similar story of your own.

A conversation should be entertaining. When you stimulate someone's interest, you need to pause and give them the chance to express their feelings about what you just said, that's the best part! Seeing how your words impacted the other person! If you just keep talking, the other person's interest will dip off again, and eventually diminish entirely when it becomes clear you have no interest in actually hearing anyone's thoughts but your own.

LifeProTips,"This is sort of a double life pro tip, one that can be used to increase your privacy, as well as give you insights of how you acted 10 years ago, what you were interested in, how your interests grew, and just how stupid you might have been. Now before I continue, I happen to find this extremely fascinating, others may find this extremely creepy. However, do what you will with this information.

First, in order to start this, make sure you're **signed into Google using a Gmail account you've been using the longest**. The older the account, the more farther back you can look. Next go to [myactivity.google.com](https://myactivity.google.com) and you're almost there. Here where it may get creepy. It shows all your Google searches and how many times and at what times you visited any websites, searched anything on Google, and which apps you've opened. Yeah, pretty creepy. But whatever, I think you can delete it somewhere.

Next, you can click on the filter options, and just think back to when you created your Gmail account. I created mine sometime before 2012, so my account is perfect for this. Long story short, filter the options using only the dates and set it to January 1st, 20XX, whatever that might be for you. And there you go, look back to what you Googled and which apps you were using and whatnot. More often than not, this will be nostalgic, and a bit creepy. But whatever. After looking back for a bit, I started rememebering what video games I was playing, which YouTubers I used to watch, and what information I was Googling.

Stay safe and Happy New Years.

EDIT: It's organized in a very weird way. You cannot choose to view older information first. Newest is always at the top. Click ""Before"" instead of ""After"" and select the date to be January 20XX, being one year ahead of the year you wanna view. Also you must view newest to oldest and cannot change it.

Process:

Power Off - > Remove Power Cord -> Remove Battery(if available) -> Hold Power button -> Test.

LifeProTips,"For those with young families who may think about taking a long trip: We have traveled literally hundreds of thousands of miles (killed 2 vans with +200k miles) with a family of 2+kids from car carrier to drinking age. The best piece of advice we found by happenstance on a trip from FL to IL kids aged from toddler to preteen. We've since made it our rules, and it's worked out amazingly. 

#1 Always get out of the car to eat. 

It started with a stop at a Krystals connected to a gas station. We sat and ate in the ""restaurant"". We realized coming back out, we were ""ready to hit the road"" again. That short 20 minute change of scenery completely changed out perspectives. We ended up at a sit down restaurant by dinner after realizing how cathartic it was. 

#2 Don't get hung up on how quickly you can get somewhere. 

I have made the FL to IL trip more times than I can count. This time we decided, ""You know, it's only a few more hours if we go via NC and OH. We've never been to those states AND we get to avoid Atlanta all together."" That changed this from a long drive to a journey.

#3 If it's going to be all day in the car. Start EARLY. 

We went FL, GA, SC, NC, VA, WV, OH, IN to IL. in one day. However, we loaded the car the night before, and were pulling away from grandma's house at 6am. By the time the kids started stirring, we we already 3 hours away in another state.

All of this really comes down to one over-arching theme. Enjoy the journey. You already accepted it wouldn't be quick when you found out it would take ""all day"" (I think of 5+hours as ""all day""). Now you just have to decide to enjoy the trip. Enjoy the conversations, enjoy the car games of I-spy, ABC's, who am I and 21 questions, and enjoy the endless wonderment of ""How much longer?"".",24029,"LPT: If you're going on a road trip that involves being in the car ""All Day"", start early, make it a journey and ALWAYS sit-down outside the car to eat.",0.93,1596641769.0,i47imt,t3_i47imt,712,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/i47imt/lpt_if_youre_going_on_a_road_trip_that_involves/,5,jvhero

LifeProTips,"The CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act. Like the European GDPR that came before it, it guarantees certain individuals rights around the use and sale of their data. More specifically, California residents can force companies to produce any data they have on them, and delete it on request. 

By law, these companies must follow through with deletion, **and reach out to any 3rd parties** to whom they sold the data, and have them delete it as well.

As an example, here's [Vizio's website](https://www.vizio.com/en/home). You'll see that ""Do Not Sell My Personal Information"" is listed in the footer. This specific language is required by law.

**If you don't live in California, you can still benefit from this law**. It's too expensive and resource intensive to figure out where a person lives and see whether the law applies to them, so companies are adhering to most requests regardless. Companies are rightly assuming that more states will enact such laws, so it's not worth splitting hairs over where you live.

The CCPA went into effect on 1/1/2020, so the footer links are starting to go live on many sites. By mid-year, enforcement begins, and you will have the ability to sue any company that fails to comply.

EDIT: LOTS of people asking about Facebook. Their footer link isn't published yet, but here's a direct link from a Google search: https://m.facebook.com/help/contact/784491318687824

EDIT 2: Please be careful when doing this. If you're using a service, and you want to keep that service, deleting your data might mean deleting your account. Some companies have data on you without an account, which is where this is very effective

EDIT 3: Yes, this is for California residents. Yes, some companies will ask where you reside. Some companies will not, because they know more and more states will enact legislation.

LifeProTips,"Disagreements/arguments are crucial to a healthy relationship with your spouse, friend or family. 

In modern times, people see arguments as being toxic in a relationship and jump ship. Work through disagreements as a team. 

The key is in how you handle the arguments. Watch what you say in the heat of the moment as you can’t take back words you said out of emotion. 

When in a disagreement/argument, slow down, understand each other’s point of views. Throw your ego out the window. This is where you’ll grow closer because you’ll learn new things about the other person.

LifeProTips,"I have chronic anemia and ever since I was a little kid, I have never known the feeling of ""waking up rested"". Friends of mine describe waking up and immediately having the energy to jump out of bed. It is always a slow crawl for me to eventually muster the energy and drag myself out.

Last week I bought a grip strength trainer to strengthen my hands and left it on my nightstand. This morning, in my stupor, I decided to put a few rounds into it half-asleep. To my great surprise, I was wide away within 10-15 minutes from this simple act of exertion getting the blood flowing. 

Try it!! It's brainless and all you do is squeeze your hand a bit which pretty much anyone should be able to do! A stress ball should also prove to be an effective alternative

Edit: A couple of things to add, the anemia in question is a genetic mutation called thalassemia. It is the result of a blood mutation that causes my hemoglobin to decompose at an abnormal rate, thus hindering my blood's ability to deliver oxygen to the rest of my body.

While this was the first time I tried this, I posted to LPT because the effect was SO noticeable over everything else I've done to try and alleviate the morning fatigue. Memory foam mattress, getting to sleep earlier, morning wank, sleeping pills, melatonin, all these had a marginal effect if any at all. But today, BAM.

LifeProTips,"I worked in the automotive industry for over 5 years. I have encountered too many people whom are unaware of how important proper tire air pressure is. The tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) in your vehicle is an aid to this matter. It is only there to let you know about drastic differences in air pressure between your tires. We have to remember that the tires on our vehicles are what dictate how well we will be able to handle said vehicle. Tires are what make contact with the road, thus should be the forefront of our safety priorities. Rather not have to use your seatbelt because you were able to brake in time, than total your vehicle due to an over inflated tire.

Yes, i said that correctly, over inflated. When we over inflate our tires, we decrease the surface area that makes contact with the road. In turn, reducing friction between the tire and road. This increases our distance to come to a stop, and how much under/over steer we experience. Over inflated tires are also more suceptable to blow outs due to the already high pressure. Over inflated tires suffer decreased life time, dangerous cracking, and decreased traction.

Under inflated tires are just as dangerous. We are more attentive to a low pressure tire because they are more visible. Severely under inflated tires can unseat from the bead, causing you to possibly lose control of your vehicle. Pot holes and bumps on the road can possibly pinch the wall of a low pressure tire, causing you to lose said tire. Decreased gas mileage is also an effect of under inflated tires. When a tire is under inflated, it does not have enough pressure to keep proper shape, thus ""folding"" under the vehicle when moving. This increase how much torque must be applied for said tires to rotate. 

Most vehicles, on the drivers door jamb, have a tire pressure information sticker. If we follow those guidelines, we will all be safer on the roads. If you find your tires to be incorrectly inflated, once corrected, you will immediately feel the difference. Gas mileage depends on how you drive but, your tires will always have an effect. Please, be safe on the roads. We already have to deal with enough to have to go through something that could of been avoided by properly inflated tires.
Lets all be safe on the roads!

LifeProTips,"Psychologists claim that telling people you're going to do something and getting their approval releases dopamine without actually doing the task, becoming a major reinforcement for not following through on plans. By keeping plans more private, you hold off on release of the addictive dopamine until it will reinforce you completing goals. It's a hack for your brain. You get addicted to getting things done!

Also, for those who like to play devil's advocate, the counter argument is that public display of goals does help for them to be achieved. There is truth to this, but is mostly refuted in terms of short term versus long term change. Public announcements hold us accountable out of fear and fear doesn't lead to long term intrinsic motivation and change only short term action as the driving force in the change is external rather than internal. 

Lastly, I'm not saying not to talk through your goals with others, just be sure you're not doing it for the affirmation of setting the goal and be selective with who needs to know (hint: it's not everybody).

LifeProTips,"Colonoscopy Prep

In light of a Chadwick Bosemans passing a lot of you might be thinking about getting a colonoscopy done. I have Crohn’s disease and have had to do a few of them in the last 5 years and though I would offer some advice for what to experience. 

You might need to do prep where you drink this terrible overly salty liquid, the one I do also tastes like fruit punch. You probably think the flavouring helps, your very wrong. Here’s a few things I do to make drinking it a little better:

1. Make sure the liquid is cold, it helps a bit

2. Chop up a lemon into wedges and rub it ALL over your tongue to try to counter the salty taste. I also like to keep the lemon by my nose as I find the smell helps with the smell from the liquid

3. To drink the liquid you are going to want a straw that comes with bubble tea, they are about a centimetre in diameter. You want to place the straw at the very back of your mouth and then try to drink as much of the liquid before you taste it. The second you get a taste stop drinking and put the lemon on your tongue. 

4. Repeat till the liquid is gone. 


Also from the prep you are going to be shitting liquid out your ass for hours, sound fun? You will want to drink as much water as you can because if you’re dehydrated they will have trouble getting an IV in you the next day. 

The colonoscopy itself is not very hard. When you wake up and you feel like you need to fart ask to go to the bathroom. The nurse will tell you to just fart but for me personally it’s always been my body expelling the lube they used for the scope, go to the bathroom and sit there for a few minutes to let the lube get out of you. 

Now your done for the day and you can go eat the best meal of your life. 

Hope this helps anyone thinking about doing a colonoscopy.

LifeProTips,"Edit: including a comment I made below to explain why price gouging is wrong. 

The seller typically is the person clearing out the aisle and sitting on it. This behavior removes access to these items from anyone unable or unwilling to pay outrageously inflated fees.

This behavior is also why my cancer-ridden mother and her friends from the chemo center are unable to get their hands on any supplies. Her friends are dying because they don’t have access to things they need to protect themselves. No masks for the leukemia patients. No disinfectant for the lung cancer sufferers. It’s not fair or acceptable to profit by making another suffer.

So next time you see $120 Clorox wipes, remember they were taken away from someone without the ability to pay that price.

Yes, it’s ok to enjoy being appreciated. No, you shouldn’t let people take advantage of you.

Obviously this tip is not about your job. If you’re working hard you should let your employers know. 

The point is, in a relationship, constantly pointing out what a martyr you are probably isn’t going to earn you respect, just contempt. And it may indicate that you need to change your mindset. Plus, knowing that you’re sacrificing for someone else without trying to gain from it can be satisfying.

Also, the other side of this is implied: show appreciation when people do things for you, without them having to point it out.


The last half of the tip may have been more harsh than I intended, but that’s because it was aimed at myself.

I was inspired to post this when I realized how much I wanted to find ways to bring up to my family how hard I work at my job, how long I suffer through traffic, how much I do when I get home, etc. 

I had to ask myself why I needed them to praise me for it. I realized it was time for me to man-up and do whatever it takes to support them, regardless of whether I’m applauded for it. I needed to shift my perspective: why should I be bitter about working hard for people I love, rather than reveling in the chance to be of service!? If they realize how much I do, great! If not, I can feel good just knowing how much I’m doing for them.

LifeProTips,"Four months out of law school or so, I was becoming relatively desperate for work. I ended up applying fora  firm that needed ""immediate help"" (LPT: that is generally going to be a red flag). I was told at the interview that I would do a variety of civil things pertaining to real property and estate planning. It was relatively vague but I needed a job and it would be good experience.

I spent my entire first day at the job learning how to foreclose on a claim of lien - that is a fancy way of saying that, if you violate the restrictive covenants (e.g. not paying yearly dues), the HOA is going to take your house away, sell it at auction for pennies on the dollar, take ""their share"" (meaning you are paying the exorbitant legal fees for the attorney that got paid to take your house away, and give you what little bit is remaining. I would learn that our firm represented over 100 HOA's in the surrounding area and my primary function was to take people's houses away.

House destroyed by a hurricane? Wife have terminal cancer? Your HOA very well may not care, at all. I've seen it. Oh boy, I have seen it. So, yeah, God forbid you end up on your last leg and then you are going to be paying for your HOA's attorneys to take your house away. Speaking of HOA attorneys, do you have any idea how much it costs the HOA to get an attorney to draft a letter saying someone's grass is too high? Easily in the ball park of a thousand dollars.

It is not just that the HOA will take your house. You are paying for someone to tell you how you can use your home. Oh, and speaking of paying, most restrictive covenants permit exponential increases in annual assessments and ""special assessments"" for basically any amount at any time, regardless of whether the money actually increases your property value.

I could whine all day but there is one more thing: never, ever, ever, take someone's word that the HOA isn't very active so it is not an issue. All it takes is one nosey neighbor to attend a handful of meetings and next thing you know she will have your HOA paying tens of thousands of dollars to some attorney to make sure your cancer struck neighbor loses their house without regard for the fact they finished paying their mortgage ten years ago.

One more thing while I am at it. I live in a town where it is next to impossible, to find a home built after 1990 without an HOA. The only strong pro-HOA argument is that HOAs preserve property value. Well, guess what, when the rest of society catches on and realizes what a plague these things are, people are going to be paying a premium to get away from HOAs and the non-HOA neighborhoods will reflect that.

Edit: Sorry, I know this came off as one sided (deservedly so in my opinion) but I should add. HOAs make sense in a few scenarios: any time a shared roof is at play (condos); you are rich and just don't care about frivolous expenditures; vacation homes; or for elderly people it may be nice to have a set community structure with the amenities. Regardless, there is probably a more suitable non-HOA for all of these options except for maybe the shared roof thing. At a minimum though, please understand what you are doing before you sign on.",15867,LPT: you must fully understand what an HOA is and read the restrictive covenants before moving into a neighborhood with an HOA.,0.95,1596658458.0,i4cw91,t3_i4cw91,1779,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/i4cw91/lpt_you_must_fully_understand_what_an_hoa_is_and/,2,hostilecarrot

The last one, I had a roommate. We were shopping for house supplies, and I went to grab a can of wasp spray, and he stops me. I still grabbed the can in case any got inside, but he said he had a solution.

So we bought some relatively small brown paper bags, fluffed them out and stapled them up around the house. And much to my surprise, the wasps were almost entirely gone in about a week.

Roommate explained that wasps think the bags are hornet nests or something, and it scares them off. I'm not sure if I believe that part, but it worked either way.

LifeProTips,"So I do a lot of white water sports and generally spend a lot of time on the water and I’ve heard/ seen too many stories of people who have only been in a pool or small pond and never been where they can’t just swim over to the shore. But they have never been in a bad situation on the water so they can’t handle it and they swim out in a river or lake that has a current or is just big and all of a sudden they are tired and the current is picking up the the shore it 100 yards away. 

I was on a class 3 rapid with some friends and we were canoeing and these two guys flipped and the two guys were fine but me and 3 others headed over to assist them and me and two of the people had been in water like that so we could hop eddies and such. The other person hadn’t been in water like that at all and they got halfway out there and grabbed a rock and panicked. They didn’t want to get off the rock and wouldn’t move. We did eventually talked her back to shore. That person stuck on the rock? She was a lifeguard. 

I promise you the water will win if you don’t know what your doing.

Please please don’t drown and read up on swift water safety so other don’t have to put their ass on the line for you.

Edit: I’m gonna add some tips but these are by no means a substitute for a professional teaching you.
The first is TRRG (throw row reach go) meaning that swimming is a last resort for saving someone and you should use a throw rope, paddle out there and try to reach them all before you get in the water.

NOSE AND TOES, meaning if you’re going down a rapid you keep you’re nose and toes above the water and toes facing down stream. You should float on your back going feet first because you would rather have your feet hit a rock then your head.

And lastly never and I mean never put your feet on the bottom when you are facing down stream. The reason is because the current will push your feet under a rock and you will not be able to pull them out and the current will rush over your back and push you on the bottom. A PFD will not save you in this situation.  if you absolutely need to put your feet down make sure you are standing backwards.",14478,LPT: you are not as good at swimming as you think you are and you shouldn’t over estimate your skill,0.93,1598971229.0,iklgv8,t3_iklgv8,668,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/iklgv8/lpt_you_are_not_as_good_at_swimming_as_you_think/,13,12093651

LifeProTips,"I work for an online store and I see this every day. People writing ""Hello"", "" Thanks"", funny jokes or funny requests into the comment field.

Or my absolute favourite: ""Please ship as fast as possible!""

Well Mister what you do not realize is that your order would have already been processed and shipped - but your comment put it out off the fully automated processing and shipping queue and now it is in the queue for orders with special requests and waiting for manual review. If you are lucky and times are not busy it will still go out the same day, but if you are not lucky your request for fast shipping just cost you one day.

**Edit:** I always wanted to write: ""Wow this blew up!"" under one of my posts. So here I go: Wow this blew up!

Some seem a little disappointed and think their “Thank You” notes are not appreciated. They are! But most of the time it's only one customer service agent who is going to read them before clicking them away.

If you want to do something nice however: Leave a review on the website or on a third party review site for everyone to see!

Especially in smaller and mid-sized companies every single review is read. Not only by the customer service but by many of the employees, too. I have even seen nice reviews printed out and attached to the packing table by employees. Also: With your reviews you help those companies compete against the giants like Amazon and keep their independence from marketplaces.

**Edit 2:** I realize my original post came across a little condescending. The point is not that you should not write any comments, but to realize that typing ""Whassuup"" into the comment box might cause a short delay of your order - depending on the companies internal processing - because someone will actually have to read this and then flag your request as ""solved""

(However requests for fast shipping ARE annoying, that's like telling the waiter not to serve your meal cold and then claiming credit for it when it actually is served hot.)

LifeProTips,"If you’re like me, you go through phases where you want to get back into shape and try really hard at it, only to lose motivation after a few weeks or months. The only time it stuck was when I planned out what would be my “minimum day”. A minimum day is just the bare minimum of what you have to do to stay on track, but is much faster and isn’t too daunting. For me, my minimum day is my run, then a two minute plank and lots of stretching and some yoga poses. Usually if I’m starting to lose motivation, I’ll do a “minimum day” instead of fully skipping a workout. And even then, after I do my run, I usually just do the full workout anyways. You’ll have to change your minimum as you progress, but I found that as working out becomes a habit, I don’t feel the need to have minimum days. 

If you’re just starting to work out, I’d plan out a minimum for you (even just a run or walk) and do that for a week or two. Just getting in the habit of getting a workout in 3-5 days a week helps long term to adjust your mindset from motivation-driven to discipline-driven.

I work as a security guard in a family shelter here in NYC. About three days ago, this little boy comes up to me during my briefing. He tells me in front of my supervisor and the regional director (I have no idea why RD was here, I started less than a month ago) and tells me ""Daddy licks my gummies"" my supervisor chimes in ""Then tell him to buy you a new bag.""

This doesn't sit right with me, so I ask the little boy to point to his gummies. Kid points to his crotch.

After briefly investigating, we get the kid out of the area and call the cops, 10 minutes later, cops are here, dad is getting arrested, I'm on the phone with momma bear and an officer. My supervisor is being chewed out by the RD.

The kid passed me 10 minutes ago with a big smile, told me he wants to be a security guard. My heart melted. 

Momma bear I currently filing a restraining order against dad. I gave her my P.i buddies business card.

Moral of the story, teach your kids the anatomical names for their parts. Had a less intelligent guard been on duty (And I hate to say I'm outnumbered 15:1) this might have gone unnoticed.

In the time it took me to write this, another little boy in the building has come to me with a similar claim. Excuse me while I call my supervisor.

LifeProTips,"I have lived in 9 properties in 10 years and with the most recent 3 properties, I have done these three things on moving day. It makes me feel more secure and more 'at home'. These will seem obvious to some, but not to everyone!

1. Change all locks. Front door, back door, window locks (if there are any - but actively look for them). Costs up to £15 for most locks and they're easy to refit or you can hire a professional if you prefer. This will cost more, but trust me, the cost is more than worth it for your piece of mind. Anyone could have a copy of the key for the lock.

Note: I'm unable to change the title but this might all cost more than £50 in total depending on how many locks you have to replace! Still worth it though!

If you're renting, tell your landlord/letting agent that you are doing this - they generally don't mind as long as you agree to give them a replacement key (as they always keep a spare in their office).

2. Change the toilet seat. Don't feel like you're in a public bathroom at home! Simple, effective and again, shouldn't cost more than £15 /$/€. It's really easy to change them and it's a good feeling afterwards.

3. Change the shower head. Again, really cheap, really easy and gives you that peace of mind 'new home' freshness. Shower heads build up bacteria and if it hasn't been changed in years, or hasn't been used for a couple of weeks if the property has been vacant, this is especially important. As you have no way of knowing how long it has been sitting there, just change it!

In my experience, you can do these three things for less than £100 (depending on how many locks there are or if you hire someone) and in less than an hour.

LifeProTips,"The Perseid meteor shower peaks on this night, every year! As our planet enters a cloud of space debris from the massive Swift-Tuttle comet we get to see up to 100 shooting stars per hour without the aid of a telescope or anything like that.

Pick a comfortable, dark place and look up into a clear sky for the best results. Make sure you have as much clear sky in your vision as possible. It may also help to angle away from the Moon if it's too bright. Staying oriented north/northeast is your best way to see them though. Visibility may be tougher deeper towards the southern hemisphere. I like to start viewing just before midnight (more on that below), then stay and relax a while. However, any time between 10pm and 4am seems to work well. You can even download mobile applications that utilize your GPS and gyroscope to perfectly locate the Perseus constellation, which is where the meteors appear to originate, hence the name.

Don't worry if you miss the peak due to seeing this late, it being cloudy, etc. This meteor shower lasts until August 24th. You will see less and less by the day but certainly will see something in the right conditions. Happy hunting out there!

I really appreciate it all, it has truly made my day, and I'm glad you are taking interest and enjoying it yourself, with family, and with me. Happy birthday as well to all the Leo's in here. I'm glad we can enjoy a special day like this! I'm continuing to reply to as many people as I can however I've noticed a trend of common questions I'd like to address here.

""Is this only for USA, where can it be seen?""
This is not USA exclusive. This can be seen mostly everywhere. Too deep into the southern hemisphere and too far towards the north pole it becomes difficult or impossible to see them due to not having the proper angle towards the sky or not having sufficient darkness, respectfully.

""When can I see them?""
This depends a lot on your location and local weather. I highly recommend downloading apps such as Sky Map, Sky View, or any other app that can track constellations full time in 360 degrees. There are many free options for both iOS and Android.

""I looked and didn't see anything.""
Make sure these conditions are met as best as possible. If the sky isn't in your favor tonight, you still have 2 more weeks!

Follow up on finding ideal viewing conditions.
Looking north/northeast 30-80° above the horizon usually does it. However, this greatly depends on your location. If you are having trouble, using an app you can see where the Perseus constellation will be in the sky for you and at what time. This constellation is where the meteors appear to originate from. The time of maximum darkness varies from area to area. Find out when it will be the darkest, make sure the origin point is in the sky near that time, and hope there is no light pollution or clouds.",12593,LPT: Look to the sky tonight to catch up to 100 shooting stars per hour!,0.97,1597191602.0,i83iq2,t3_i83iq2,395,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/i83iq2/lpt_look_to_the_sky_tonight_to_catch_up_to_100/,17,iyaksrayi

LifeProTips,"I've literally never struck out with this question. It almost always produces a smirk from the interviewer, because it's kind of cheeky, but it also just gives them an open-ended prompt to get personal, and it provides you with some useful information.

It also invites candidness, because at the end of the day, they're still a person with a job, and everyone has something about their job they don't like. It's a very easy way to get to that place where an interview just becomes a casual conversation with lots of back and forth rapport, which almost always bumps you up the list.

Most importantly, it has this gentle unspoken subtext of, ""I want this job, but I'm not an idiot or a doormat, so let's switch things for a second. You persuade me"". Which in my experience interviewers tend to enjoy and be impressed by.

Usually you'll get something like...

""Ha, that's a good one. I'd say my favorite thing is that we do a lot of charity, which [bla bla bla]. My least favorite thing would probably be, we get really slammed around the holidays, which can be stressful because [yadda yadda yadda]"".

And of course, if they try to skirt around the second part of the question, that may be a red flag.

---

Edit: I should probably add that I'm speaking as someone who's been on both sides of the interview table, and on both the giving and receiving ends of this question.

I should also add: some of the comments in this thread that respond negatively to this question seem to be doing so from the perspective that you should never challenge an interviewer or do anything that has even the slightest potential to make them uncomfortable.

But implicit in that is the assumption that, as a potential hire, your goal in an interview is to ""pass the test""...and nothing else. Which I don't think is the case. You're also there to feel out the culture and determine whether THEY would be a good fit for YOU, to screen out jobs/companies you might realize you actually hate three months in. If an interviewer responds negatively to a question like this, that in and of itself provides you with priceless data about the culture there.

But as others have pointed out, there are obviously many ways to phrase this, some more nuanced and tactful (e.g. ""...and what's one thing you would change?"").",12458,"LPT: During an interview, when you're invited to ask a question, ask ""What's your favorite thing about working here, and what's your LEAST favorite?""",0.95,1588165403.0,ga91t8,t3_ga91t8,330,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ga91t8/lpt_during_an_interview_when_youre_invited_to_ask/,4,BMCarbaugh

Sometimes even when you give a 2 weeks notice, companies are not always required to pay you your accumulated PTO!! Some fine line in the employee handbook may say that the company is required to pay only 50%, which is a lot of money if you have many hours cumulated.

There are many ways to ask this that do not put serious pressure on the host.

LifeProTips,"I wanted to make this post for young people in particular, but I feel it applies quite broadly.

I have Tourrettes Syndrome. This is a very misunderstood condition. When most people think Tourrettes, they think ""involuntarily cursing"". That is a even more niche sub condition called Coprolalia. It's quite rare. People also often assume that it's a cognitive impairment condition, which is also incorrect.

For me, it primarily manifests as involuntary muscle tics, such as shaking my head, or rolling my wrists, and less often as a verbal tic; clearing my throat or sniffing.

As an adult, I've rarely had negative interactions with people. The tics come and go in levels of severity, so some people don't even know I have it. If they ask, I explain. 

As a kid, I was not often given such an opportunity, nor did I posses the eloquence to articulate what I was going through.

I was bullied pretty ruthlessly.

Usually I responded to the bullying by getting upset or shutting down. Neither did more than add fuel to the fire. However, there was an incident when I was 15 that drastically changed how I addressed things.

I was waiting with some friends for the School Bus to take us home and some guy came up to me, got in my face and starting calling me names mocking me.

I'd never met him before. I didn't know his name. I was about to get upset, and then for some reason I didn't.  

Instead I calmly asked ""Why are doing this? I dont know you. Did I do something to you for you to treat me this way?""

He paused, and then he turned around a left.

Days later he came up to me in the hallway and asked if we could talk. 

He apologized and said that he doesn't know why he acted that way. He said that when I asked him why he was doing it, he realized he didn't have an answer and that he then he thought about how he would have felt in my position. 

I was shocked, but I accepted his apology and forgave him. We actually became good friends after that.

This interaction drastically changed how I approached bullying. Any time it happened, I would use this approach and 1 for 1 it would stop.

The person either apologized or just left me alone.

If any of you are going through anything similar, I would recommend trying this approach. Take a deep breathe, look them in the eyes and ask ""why?"".

It may not solve every situation, but it helped me and I hope it helps you too.

Edit: I wanted to respond to those who advocate violence as a solution.

Prior to the incident I described, I had gotten into many fights with bullies. I was not a small kid. By 15, i was 6'1 and more than capable of demolishing those who targeted me, and on several occasions I did.

Every time, I regretted it immensely. Violence is always an option, but it's a zero sum game. All it resulted in was fear of me and mocking from a distance.

When I used communication instead, the outcome was vastly different.

I'm not saying my solution is a perfect one, but I beleive that communication is the universal solvent. It should be the first option and the primary ""weapon"" in your arsenal against people. You'd be surprised how effective it is.",10412,LPT: The best way to respond to a bully Is to genuinely and openly question their motives and intentions.,0.93,1595384506.0,hvl9ic,t3_hvl9ic,401,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/hvl9ic/lpt_the_best_way_to_respond_to_a_bully_is_to/,6,southwoodhunter
LifeProTips,"Moving a family member into a nursing home this weekend. I asked why they chose the place they did, and was told from my aunt ""because the nails were clean and it shows the staff cares about the people"".

Edit- For all the ""wow, yeah let's only look at nails to determine care""...

Noticing the appearance of nails is a very quick, non confrontational way to see if the staff pays attention to something that takes a quick minute to do. Obviously, it shouldn't be the only or most important aspect of making such a huge decision.

Residents have their rights and that must always be the best way to think and approach care but if they're dirty or have poop underneath the nails, that becomes a health/safety issue. Eating food while poop is on/underneath nails shows that proper and quality of care isn't being done. 

Also, yes I understand some people/culture says you must take care of your family. But there are times that you just need extra help or need to move them to a facility that will keep them safe. So for an example, your mother has severe alzheimers and likes to exit seek. So you buy cameras, alarms, sleep in the same room, etc.. you had just gotten off work and work was extremely stressful/busy so you go to bed a little earlier than normal because you are so tired. You get your mother ready to lay down as well and everything is going well that night, until your mother gets up and starts wandering around the house but you have no idea because you're just sleeping so well. She finds the door to outside but the alarms malfunction and now she is outside in the middle of the night, and it's 0* outside. You wake up in the morning, to find she's not in bed. You start looking around the house and find the door is open, you find her outside, dead, frozen cold. Cases like that happen more often than you think, maybe not the same way but things like that happen. It's not ""throwing"" someone away or to prison. Are there instances that, that happens? Of course and it's awful. But having peace of mind that your mother will be safe is often the number 1 decision to consider LTC.

LifeProTips,"I don't care what the context is, stretching applies to everything. Stretching not only reduces the risk of injury but also increases quality of life by improving posture and decreasing muscle tightness.

Going to do some physical activity? Do some dynamic stretches (with movement) to get muscles warmed up. 

Just finished physical activity? Static stretches (regular stretches they teach you in gym class) will prevent muscles from being tight.

Been sitting on your ass the entire day (cause of work OR laziness)? Stretching will offset the negative effects of whatever bad posture you had, and will help increase blood flow.

Feeling body aches and pains? Stretch it out. Most likely muscle tightness.

Make stretching a part of your daily routine, like flossing. It's one of those things that you won't realize the benefits of doing until you stop doing it after having done so for months.

Just like compound interest, the earlier you start taking advantage of it, the sooner you'll be able to reap the benefits. Doesn't matter what age you are. If you're 22 and below, stretching will help keep you feeling young and spry. If you're older than that, it'll undo a lot of the minor aches and discomfort you feel.

EDIT - Each stretch should only be 30 seconds. Any less and it's ineffective, any more and you don't get any additional benefits from it.

EDIT 2: Electric Boogaloo - I'm not a physiotherapist or a doctor, but I've gotten the information above from several physiotherapists and registered massage therapists. I've experienced firsthand the benefits of stretching (which have led to better flexibility, overall quality of life improvement, etc) since i started doing it daily a few years ago. 

I also forgot to include the mental benefits of daily stretching, as you can use that 5-10 minutes to clear your mind/meditate. That's basically what yoga is anyway :)

EDIT 3 - For those asking for sources:

[Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-importance-of-stretching)

[UC Davis](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/blog/archive/healthy-habits/why-stretching-extremely-important)

And in this thread i learned that some of the studies are inconclusive/have mixed results, so here's a [piece from the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20047931) as well, which states this.

EDIT 4 - I'm not advocating difficult stretches, just basic ones to help relieve tightness. Obviously, a healthy, nutritious lifestyle by eating properly, keeping active, getting enough sleep are more important than stretching. However for a lot of people, including myself, 15 minutes of basic stretching every day was what got me started on this path, not to mention the mental health benefits i got from it as well (breathing, meditation, and clearing my mind).

EDIT 5 - Last edit hopefully: WARM UP FIRST BEFORE WORKING OUT, SPORTS, OR OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.

DO NOT DO STATIC STRETCHES (especially strenuous ones) BEFORE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OR IF YOUR MUSCLES ARE COLD.

I never advocated for this, and I hope no one misinterpreted that. 

Be active, and be healthy while doing so.

LifeProTips,"Irish soda bread takes less than an hour to make and it's a very forgiving bread. Unlike some bread/pastries it still tastes good even if you mess it up.

Here is the recipe I use : https://www.recipetineats.com/no-yeast-bread-irish-soda-bread/

I substitute buttermilk for 2 cups milk and 1.5 teaspoons of lemon juice (you can also use vinegar)

The bread rises through the release of gas cause by the baking soda reacting to the lemon juice. As such, it's important to get it in the oven quickly (within 3 minutes) once you mix the wet and dry ingredients. I recommend prepping everything you need before you start mixing.


Good luck, and stay safe!

>1 Tbsp Baking Powder

>1 tsp Salt

LifeProTips,"For context, I am a 21-year-old college student. Although normally I'm the one taking classes rather than teaching them, I've had a part-time-job for the last few summers teaching math to kids, and this summer I'm doing it on Zoom for the first time.

After my college went online last semester, I was absolutely guilty of being a ""lurker"" in most of my classes. I never turned on my camera, usually attended from my bed, and often got super distracted during lecture (or skipped lecture entirely) knowing that it would be recorded anyways.

Now that I'm teaching, I'm realizing how difficult it is to teach in this environment, and how much student interaction is absolutely vital. Speaking into the void and getting no response from a sea of people with microphone and camera off is extremely demoralizing and lonely (and has made my teaching worse, since I cannot gauge student engagement or whether I'm going too fast). I dread going into the ""classroom"" now.

The few students who participate every day are a total lifesaver. In the past, I never remembered any of my students' names or faces, but now I know each and every one of those who speak (both because their participation is more appreciated, and because I have a written reminder of their name every time they do speak). I've seen the same phenomenon in my college classes: those who participate and make an effort to look professional get significant recognition from the professors and are always referred to by their names.

Also, turning on your camera and forcing yourself to look focused and professional will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your work ethic. Pretending to look focused will actually make you focus, and taking classes from your bed or without wearing pants is generally a poor way to learn.

EDIT: Of course, not all of us have the privilege to be able to do this, as a lot of people have poor internet connection.

Also, a lot of people are saying that using the chat is a good compromise. Keep in mind that, if your professor is screen sharing, as lecturers often are, they very likely cannot see the chat at all, even if they can see your faces. I've heard this from professors and experienced this myself, it's quite cumbersome to keep checking the chat on Zoom while screen sharing.

My daughter (almost 11) wanted a way to earn money, so I gave her some cleaning chores to earn an allowance. Once she completed each job, I would give her payment. However... “clean” to her is different than it is to me. So I started hiding her payments (in change) in more difficult to find areas, some wrapped with a piece of paper containing a description of how that area should be cleaned. It became a game to her and now every time I ask her to clean her room, she gets excited and details the whole thing for maximum allowance... up to $5 for her room. After each time she says she is done, I walk through with her and take any change she didn’t find... these days I’m lucky to find a single quarter she left behind.

LifeProTips,"Wow, I'm incredibly amazed by the number of people who commented and upvoted.  Thanks!  I tried to reply to a ton of you and noticed a common theme.  Many people provide the following two comments:

1.  What can you fix on the side of the road anyway?
2.  Where can I learn more about my car?

Answers:
1.  You can pull debris out from under the engine compartment (could sound like a banging noise).  You could also patch punctures in a radiator tube and top off your radiator.  If your car blows a fuse (as apparent by maybe a radio that won't play, or air conditioning that stops, or in my case, the total loss of a digital dashboard) you could replace a fuse pretty easily.  Most critically, you can assess whether or not the car is safe to drive.

2.a.  There are two main sources of literature I would highly recommend, the first is the Haynes Manuals.  They are well written and really geared at DIYers and people who are generally trying to take care of and fix their car.  I think they run about $20, but I usually get one off of eBay within a week of picking out the make/model/year of the car I'm looking for.  These manuals have been around since the 50s or 60s and are worth their weight in gold.  I can't tell you how much money Haynes has saved me.
2.b.  The dealer/manufacturer Shop Manual.  These are much more expensive and in depth than the Haynes Manual.  A Shop Manual will be hundreds of dollars new, but pretty quickly it's pirated and you can get a disk on eBay.  If you need to do less conventional repairs (let's say your car flooded and you're trying to figure out the proper voltage in the wiring harness to the transmission, the Shop Manual would tell you specific voltage, while the Haynes Manual probably won't).

I tried to be brief, but it expanded quite a bit.  Neither here nor there, I would HIGHLY ENCOURAGE anyone to try to fix their car.  Listen... the worst thing that happens is you tow it to a mechanic and he charges you to fix it anyway.

Ysense - Surveys and other tasks

HoneyGain- You get paid for browsing the internet every month , maybe $40 or so

&#x200B;

This got a very positive response when I posted a few months ago so I thought I'd put it out there again, Personally I use a combination of these sites to earn around £1000-£1500 a month. Hopefully it can be of help to more people, shoot me a message if you have any questions

&#x200B;

EDIT: Ok so the reason I said I use a combination of these sites is because I have used all of them at one time or another, but here is my current combination:

Appen/Lionsbridge- Most recently worked as a social media evaluator which payed $15 per hour and gave me around 10 hours per week

Clickworker- I use the UHRS section,“Universal Human Relevance System”. It’s a partner website that can be accessed over clickworker.com and where you can process additional jobs. You can earn a lot more this way

Neevo- Various tasks , up to $1 per task approx

VipKid and other english teaching sites- I also put ads on a spanish site called tusclasesparticulares offering skype classes. Here is a link to a lot of different English teaching sites you can use from different countries

GG2U- Surveys, good site with good payout, probably average of 1$ per survey

20cogs- A good way to earn £200+ in a relatively short time

Serpclix - Good one for tasks/surveys...intall on your browser and it will let you know when there are some available

Qmee- Surveys, good site

Prolific- Surveys- Can pay very well

HoneyGain- You get paid for browsing the internet every month , maybe $40 or so

These would be my go to sites, and I sporadically check for work on the others too if I have the time.

I spend 2 hours a day doing this to earn £1000 per month but it's usually higher than that. You have to earn £33 per day in order to hit the £1000 per month mark, which is very doable when you have 20 or so sites to work with.

For me at the moment it's usually a one hour class which makes me £15 and then a combination of projects from Lionsbridge (which currently pays about $15 dollars for an hour) and then a couple of random short tasks or surveys from one of the other sites, or more if I don't do a class...Takes a while to fine tune it and I'm always modifying the combination but believe me it's more than doable. As I say, you just need to hit that £33 a day, which is actually even easier to hit in dollars if you prefer to think of it that way.

&#x200B;

Also, and this is only useful to people in the UK, I am currently doing ""Matched Betting"" because the Premier league is on now and more and more sporting fixtures are making a comeback. Match betting is where you bet on one outcome in the bookies and then bet against that outcome in the exchange, with both bets at almost the same odds.

So for example, If you bet £10 for Real Madrid to win at odds of 2.5 on the betting site, and then bet for Real Madrid not to win(i.e bet against them) on the exchange at the same odds, you are covered in all outcomes, win lose or draw.

This means you have fullfilled the requirements of the betting sites offer (for example, Bet £10 and get £40 in free bets) without actually gambling, since there is no risk of losing the £10 you bet since it's matched. You then do the exact same thing with your £40 free bets, and this is where you make the profit since you're not using £40 of your own money.

Yes It's totally legal, just a loophole in the system really, although I was very suspicious of it at first. I wrote a guide explaining how to do it, you can find it at the top of my profile if you are interested. I have made about £700-£800 per month from doing this, on top of the money from other sites, but obviously this means putting in more time!

LifeProTips,"Walk with confidence and purpose. Make eye contact and don’t be the first to drop it. 

I know a lot of people will say they are too anxious or they are ugly, etc but this is something I’m doing in exposure therapy and honestly it’s helped immensely. 

Walk with a straight back (as much as you are able to) and keep your head up. If someone approaches you practice making eye contact and smiling. If you look away don’t look down, look forward. 

Walking with a straight back shows self control, helps posture and confidence. 

Keeping your head up shows attentiveness and purpose. 

After making eye contact looking down shows insecurity and defeat but looking straight forward and keeping eye level shows pride in yourself and again confidence. 

It will suck at first. No good thing comes easy. You will feel awkward and not like your yourself but I promise if you practice it WILL get easier and even become natural to you. This helps with insecurity and make it easier to be in public. 

People will want to have what you have. You don’t need to be a 10/10 to make people wish they had your secrets and confidence. 

Now go get em ;)

Edit: So a couple issues came up. 

1) Yes you need to be able to see so looking straight or up might be an issue so you’ll have to learn how to look ahead of you rather than down. 

2) No, you don’t have to make a crazy amount of eye contact or smile and specifically not with random men or people who seem threatening to you. Best to give it a couple seconds of smiling and then look forward or at whatever you were looking at. If the person looks sketchy than yes smiling might not be your best option. Smiling is more for the social benefit but if there is none a nod or simply eye contact for a couple second is fine.

3) You don’t necessarily NEED to smile. A smirk or just a look of cool works too.

LifeProTips,"***Edit:*** *as* u/NoBSforGma *pointed out, you really need to be TOUGH. It's fine to be nice and polite with a car salesman, but don't mistake the friendliness for anything more than them trying to make a sale. It's the same thing as dining out. The waitress isn't in to you... She just wants a nice big tip. If you aren't tough, I highly recommend car shopping with someone who is, who knows how to haggle and tell a salesman to bugger off.*

*Another good tip, courtesy of* u/cjr91 *-  Take the paperwork home with you also if you do sleep on it overnight. When I was buying my last car the numbers seemed off somehow between the negotiated price for the new car and what they wanted to give me for the trade-in. When I got home and added up the numbers without the salesman buzzing in my ears I found they sneaked in an extra $500 that was obscured by the total price of the new car being broken out into multiple line items.*

^(I'm also speaking mainly about purchasing a used car.)

This should come in handy for first time car buyers. It's very easy to walk up to a dealership, see a shiny car, get swayed by the salesman into a a test drive, and before you know it, you're sitting in his office and he's crunching your monthly payments. These guys make commission so they will do everything to get you to purchase the car - this includes purposely confusing you with pricing, promos and interest rate plans. They will always tell you that the car you are interested in may be gone tomorrow. In most cases, it will sit there for weeks, or sometimes months before someone buys it. Don't ever put a deposit on a car unless you have already been shopping around and you are absolutely sure that you've decided to make the purchase. Always sleep on it before signing a car contract, because asking for a deposit back causes salesman to become ravenous dogs in a last-ditch effort to get your money.

&#x200B;

Make many visits to many dealerships. It may take a while, but a car is a long term expense with very little ROI. Don't drive off with something you may regret buying when your first payment comes through and it's 400$ with 250$ in insurance cause you just HAD to get that Nissan Murano V6 turbo.

&#x200B;

**Additionally**

* Purchase from a dealer if you can. Not a lot. Dealers usually have inspections done and include warranties. Lots just want to move volume and their interest rates are gouging.
* Don't ever sign a car contract until you shop around for insurance quotes.
* Se a car you like? Go back home, sleep on it, and do online research into the reliability of the vehicle.
* Go car shopping with somebody who is experienced in it, so you don't get screwed by greedy salesmen.",6890,"LPT: don't buy the first car you test drive. The salesman is lying.

I have bipolar disorder, ADHD and a few head injuries from gymnastics. The combination of forgetfulness, fogginess, demotivation and physical symptoms can lead to dishes and garbage accumulating in my room. My family and friends relentlessly shamed and teased me for being “dirty and lazy” to the point where i just accepted that i was disgusting and didn’t know how to fix it. i saw another person post about having drank out of a moldy can by mistake and asking for advice on keeping up with meal cleanup, and they shared that they had executive dysfunction. This is something i never realized i had, so i asked my therapist about it. In general, it causes problems in behavioral, emotional and cognitive areas. Symptoms range in severity and can result from different health problems. 

Or, you just might be messy! Which is fine, no one is perfect and you don’t need to feel ashamed. 

I took home the skills from my restaurant job to my mess. (seriously, just throwing everything in a dish bin). Plates, silverware, napkins, cans, bottles. Aaaand just like at my job, *everything* went in. Mostly full cans? Don’t know how old they are? Moldy plates? Yes! The beauty of the dish bin is it can handle a lot of weight and is leak-proof/washable.

My family still makes fun of me, so i wait until they’re busy or I’m home alone to bring everything down. Then i can separate the garbage and recyclables into their respective areas and I’m left with the remaining dishes. I’ll scrape the food from the plates and drain liquid if needed. And then finally, yet another reason i wont shut up about the dish bin, is because i can drizzle some soap in and soak everything in hot water. 

It takes me 10-20 minutes, depending on how much I’ve accumulated. Sometimes i only have the energy to grab a few things, and sometimes i can do it all. Honestly, it can get gross, but this has made purging my “depression nest” less stressful over the years. I hope this is helpful to someone! :)

Edit: i just want to add that this is a temporary fix for when I’m doing particularly badly. My room isn’t a dumpster fire all the time, but this time of year is when I’m most depressed and things can pile up. I have the bin on stand by for when i DO need it, i don’t use it as a sink 24/7. It helps to clean up an overwhelming, and possibly embarrassing mess efficiently. I’m so happy many of you feel like this is going to be helpful ♥️

LifeProTips,"Phone cameras don't have lenses that move to zoom in and out. That means the zoom feature is what's called a digital zoom, which just zooms in on the image and doesn't actually manipulate the lenses to get a true zoom in on the object. That's why the quality degrades the closer you zoom in. 

Unless you have a newer phone with multiple cameras that are built to different focal lengths, zooming in just degrades the overall quality of the image. It also makes it harder to get a clean shot because the more you zoom in the more every little shake and tremble affects the image. 

**Solution:** the image will have the same quality whether you zoom in or not, so just stay zoomed out to eliminate the shake and when you go to crop it out you have a lot more real estate to work with. 

Got the idea after a friend of mine showed me his 6K camera and told me about how now he doesn't need multiple cameras or to mess with it to get different shots.

LifeProTips,"So I recently learned that there is a flaw in Windows laptops that run Intel chips that make them run massively hot and incredibly slow, and this flaw is ridiculously easy to fix, even if it can be a little time consuming.

Go to your power options, click on your power plan, and click ""Change Plan Settings"", then ""Change Advanced Power Settings"". Go under ""Processor Power Management"" in the dropdowns, select ""Maximum Processor State"", and set both battery and plugged in to 99%. This works on Dell, Acer, and probably other brands that run Intel CPUs.

**If you're like me, who is forever cursed to have their laptops rendered only quasi-functional, you may have to go into your Registry Editor in order to make the option actually display. In RegEdit, go to “Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power"", and set CsEnabled to 0. E: As with all registry editing actions, you need to restart your computer for it to take effect.** E: Bolded for emphasis since a lot of people seem to not be seeing this part.

When you ask ""do you have any questions?"" it pre-supposes that the person doesn't have any questions. It's like saying ""you don't have any questions right? because if you did, you're stupid"". It's even worse if you are in a position of authority over the person your explaining something to (i.e. you're a teacher, a supervisor, etc...)
When you ask ""what questions do you have?"" it's like telling the person ""I expect you have questions, it's ok to ask for clarification"". It will totally change the responses you get, and the effectiveness of your teaching.
I'm a doctor, and I frequently need to explain something to someone that I understand better than they do. It's very easy to forget that a patient who's just come to the hospital to have a baby may have only had 1 or 2 babies, while you have gone through the process of caring for a pregnant woman thousands of times. You may think it's just another normal day, but for them, this could be something they've never done.
I see my colleagues all the time fall into a trap where they use big words, don't explain things in terms their patients can understand, and then intimidate them away from asking questions.
No matter what it is you're explaining, remember that if you are the one teaching or explaining something, you're doing so because you know more than the person you are talking to, and so it's only natural they will have questions.

LifeProTips,"This is the one self care tip that has helped me a lot in my struggle with mental illness. If you’re depressed, angry, anxious and it ruining your day and you know you need to use positive self talk but can’t manage it. Forget your brain for a bit. Do something nice for your body. I like to take a shower but throw in some extra nice things like, shaving my legs, exfoliating, using a nice smelling thing, putting on my favorite shirt after, eating something you love after. Etc. it not only distracts you, but it helps to show kindness to yourself when it’s hard to do it in your brain. This also works vice versa. Having a sick day and it’s getting you down? Do something nice for your brain. Watch your favorite show, make yourself laugh with some memes etc. this may seems obvious to others but it’s really saved me in times I was at rock bottom.

Edit: thanks for all the karma that’s wicked cool. Also I know a lot of you are saying this takes energy you don’t have, but it can be something as small as taking a nap, taking your meds, drinking a bit of water. I hope soon the universe throws you a break and you can catch a glimmer of good. In the meantime, I implore you too seek therapy if you have access and look and try out some coping mechanisms to help you through.

LifeProTips,"I'm a marketing executive for a mid sized company and I hire a lot of people. 

The number one mistake I see applicants make that is rarely mentioned is choosing a delayed interview date. 

For example, we may offer the applicant a few time slots over the next couple days, but the applicant asks if we can do following week instead. Or we may ask if they can hop on a call tomorrow, but they ask if we have time 3 days from now. Maybe because they're busy, can't get off work, or just want more time to prepare.

While I understand the myriad of reasons people ask to delay interviews... even waiting a day or two often costs them the job. ESPECIALLY if its a secondary or followup interview. 

Typically how the hiring process works is after initial screenings of resumes and applicants, hiring managers will block off spaces of time when they're available for interviews. Often they'll schedule some back to back in marathon sessions. We may block off slots for 10 qualified, pre-screened applicants.  

But Interviews are a pain in the ass. They're time consuming and can be exhausting after doing many in a row. So unofficially, we want to interview as few people as possible to find a great candidate. Additionally, we always assume every good candidate has competing job offers. 

Very often, the first really great interview we get we say internally ""this is our guy (or girl)!"". We may conduct other interviews after that, but the first good one really sets the bar for everyone else. And in our heads, we'll be weighing other interviews against them.

 But more importantly, as soon as we are really impressed by an interviewee...we often begin discussions with the rest of the team about hiring them. Frequently we could even get an offer out to them the same day so we don’t risk losing them to a competing offer.  If you decided to pick a time a day or 2 later, we may still proceed with the interview in case that first person declines.... but you're now at a huge disadvantage. If you decided to pick one too late, we may cancel your interview altogether.

However if you were smart, picked that early day and manage to impress us as a super qualified, and great-fit candidate in the interview, you've given your chances a big boost. Even if there are other great applicants waiting in the wings, we might cancel them and never know they're actually a better choice than you. 

 So my advice to everyone during a job search is do whatever you can to get the earliest possible interview slot. If you can't do the first time slot offered, then at least make it happen the first day. Move things around, request a ""doctors appointment"" time off at your current job, hide in the bathroom at work...whatever you need to do. 

And if you want to give yourself even more of an extra edge, choose the earliest offered date, but ask if they can do an even earlier date. 

Keep in mind, i'm not suggesting we always hire the first good candidate we talk to...or that the time slot itself has baring on qualifications. Especially if theres applicants we especially had our eye on. I'm just saying its advantageous not to risk waiting until later. It’s better to be #5 of 20 than 15 of 20.

Caveat...this doesn't apply to every company. And there are definitely competing theories with my take on this... 

Some companies have more formalized hiring processes that always interviews all applicants before decisions are made. And some managers say that actually not going first increases your chances of the interviewer having their mind together. 

But without knowing their process, at least in my experience, getting in early gives you a better chance than being too late. 

**edit** clarifying some seem to be interpreting this as my implying the first applicants always get hired first. To be clear, we go with the best, most qualified possible candidate we can find from an applicant pool... but if you’re a great candidate who interviews early on, we may offer you the job before we have a chance to interview everyone else",4946,"LPT: If you're invited to a job interview and given a list of potential dates/times to meet, always choose the earliest slot.

LifeProTips,"Disclaimer: Some of this may be regional (appliance deposits, I'm in Louisiana) research is key. 

I'm 29, married and just bought my first home. Please do not go into this blindsided. 

So when buying a home with a realtor you do not pay them, they are paid by the seller once you close. Our realtors were amazing, they weren't from a major firm. Even since we've closed they've helped us move appliances in and so much more. They're doing it so that when we go to sell, they know we will call them first.      

Good-faith deposit - paid when you make an offer, tells the seller you are serious, does not always apply, can be between 0-$1000+     

Inspection - $300-$500 this is to make sure the home doesn't have defects. If they are found you can ask the sellers to fix them, they may say no. 

Appraisal - ~$500 checks the value of the home against other homes in the area most similar to yours. Some banks may not finance the home for more than the appraised price, the seller may choose to drop to the appraised price or they may not. If it appraises for higher than the selling price, you do not have to tell the seller.    


Closing costs - ~3% of the selling cost of the home. I just closed at $198k and our closing costs were ~6k. You can see if the sellers will cover some costs. We got them to cover 5k of them. Your realtor will be able to negotiate this. 

Look out for PMI which is a mortgage insurance. I didn't have to pay this because I am on a VA loan.   

What is escrow? Escrow is when they take your homeowners insurance and property taxes and roll them into your monthly payment. Our mortgage is $860/mo, but the escrow brings it to $1100. 

Also shop around for interest rates. We got a 3.25% which saved us a ton of money.

Here's the fun. You've bought the home and want to move in.

Here is what we needed.   

Electricity - May require a deposit, if you had power before you may ask for a letter of credit to waive the deposit.    

Water - requires a deposit.    

Sewage - requires a deposit.    

Gas - requires a deposit.    

Trash - requires a deposit.    

Internet - may require an activation fee, Att was running a special and waived it.    

Appliances - the previous owners took the washer, dryer and fridge. They left the microwave, oven, and dishwasher. Lowe's and Home Depot's stock is so bad in our area that we had to drive 40 minutes away and pay $1100 more than we wanted to. Our washer and dryer won't be delivered for another two weeks. Not to mention a lawnmower, which they only had one in stock and we had to buy one so the HOA wouldnt fine us. In total we spent $4600 on appliances and lawnmower because of shortages due to covid.    

We started with about $7200 in savings and are down to about $800 from everything we had to pay.   

Our neighborhood offers a $99 quarterly pest control and we have a home security system that costs $50/mo. If you want the remote services (in case something happens when you arent home).   

Thats not including a shed if you don't want to store the lawn mower and gasoline in the garage.   

Tldr: there is so much that goes into just buying the home that people forget about the stuff post buying the home. Good luck everyone.

Edit: MONEY DOWN some may ask for up to ~~20k~~ 20% down deposit. Because I had a VA home loan we did not have to put any money down.

LifeProTips,"I saw a post earlier advising people to offer coffee to handymen when they are working in their homes. I am begging you, PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS!! I work as a handyman. I have been working inside people's homes my entire adult life, and I can honestly say, it creates a horrible amount of unnessecary tension. No, I do not want to drink your coffee, I happened to bring my own. No, I don't want you to run to Burger King, and get me a lunch, eating a meal on the job tends to slow me down, and it feels awkward sitting down for a meal with a complete stranger who just bought the meal. On top of that, in my experience, the customers who offer food or coffee, are usually the ones who end up asking for free shit. ""Hey, I just bought you a burger, think you could take a look at my bedroom door real quick?"" So I find it is always easier to say ""No"" to anything and everything offered. Now I have to go through the awkward conversation of denying hospitality, only to get that cliche ""Are you sure?"" YES I'M SURE!! I WOULD NOT HAVE SAID 'NO' IF I ACTUALLY WANTED SOME!

Sorry for the yelling, but please don't take advice on how to treat handymen from someone who clearly has never worked as one. Take it from me, we don't appreciate it. It creates an awkward situation. Whatever you do, don't ever, EVER offer food and/or coffee to the Handyman. He will appreciate NOT being offered. Trust me.

EDIT: You have to keep in mind, your house is the handyman's office, and you are the customer. Imagine being in your place of employment, and suddenly, your customer/clients start offering you free stuff. You offering the handyman a cup of coffee, would be the equivalent of a customer in a restaurant offering a cup of coffee to the server. It's ridiculous. Do not do it.

LifeProTips,"When meeting someone you want to have a friendly relationship with (peer, coworker etc) act like you've been friends for years already. 

Let your face light up when you see them like they've made your day by being there. Ask them how they're doing and empathise. Share stuff back, like you would with a friend and not just a stranger - don't be afraid to be a little vulnerable as you're creating a safe space for them to share their vulnerabilities. If you make sure that the message your words/face/body language convey when you're around them is ""I like you as a person"", eventually, they start to like you back and BOOM friendship! 

I accidentally found this out years back by sitting down and chatting to a stranger in my class thinking she was someone I knew - we ended up hanging out for the rest of the year!  I've been using this technique ever since and now small talk and meeting new people feels natural. 

This post is for my younger self, who really struggled with making new friends. I read library books, articles and took notes from TV shows on how to interact with others and still didn't *really* get it. 

Hopefully it helps for some of you too - it may seem like common sense but maybe there's some others out there that were like me.

LifeProTips,"It’s okay to roam around the general area, like 10 square meters. Rustle around, leave your scent, yell, scream, cry, post about your lost dog on Facebook, but for the love of your pup DO NOT LEAVE THAT AREA TO LOOK FOR THEM. 

If the dog is out of sight and you search for them, then you almost eliminate the chance of them coming back to that spot for you, and that is your greatest chance of finding them. 

Sure, if you have multiple people, split up. As long as somebody is at the one location your dog knows where to go back to.

My anecdotal experience:
I lost my dog at the park. He rustled around the trails for a while and then was gone. I wanted to be proactive, search for him.

My SO wanted us to drive around and look for him. I stayed put and sure enough he came back an agonizing forty five minutes later.

LifeProTips,"First: avoid this technique if you are pregnant or suffer a heart disease!

Second, here's the technique: breathe a normal breath in, then out, and pinch your nose while you hold your breath. While breath-holding, nod your head or start swaying side to side or walking. When a big air-hunger is created, stop moving and breathe in through your nose. You'll find your airways are clearing! Repeat five times for your nose to get completely unblocked. Continue breathing through your nose to avoid reversing back to that stuffy nose. 

I've known plenty of people who are unable to breathe through their nose because of a stuffy nose, be it because of allergies or deviated septums. If this is the case, I want to point out that you don't have to live that way. Mouth breathing is dangerous and leads to anxiety, bad rest, attention deficit and depression. Check out James Nestor, Steve Maxwell or Patrick McKeown for more free info. Breathe Right!

Edit: Glad to see people getting results. I'll add a few notes, since many people are asking.
Note 1: don't breathe through your mouth. Just keep it shut and relax into your nose breath.
Note 2: if your nose gets blocked again after a minute, find yourself a certified breathing coach because you might be a heavy breather. But don't sweat it, 50-70% of the population are according to the science, but learning proper breathing will probably fix most issues you are having. 
Note 3: if your problem is a deviated septum, search for Steve Maxwell and a technique called Rolfing. (I had misspelled the treatment). 
Note 4: if you repeat the technique many times, then do some long and powerful exhales afterwards to lower the acidity caused by the accumulated CO2.

LifeProTips,"I volunteered at a shelter that took in animals lost, displaced, or temporarily surrendered during Hurricane Harvey. 

The influx of pets in an emergency situation often totals in the hundreds - if not thousands. This means volunteers will have an even harder time trying to locate your missing pet. Even if your pet is in safe hands with a rescuer, shelters fill up and your pet may be relocated without you knowing. The only guaranteed way for us to find your pet is if it's microchipped. Collars are easily lost and are not enough.

Also helpful - if your pet travels in a hardshell crate, write some basic contact information directly onto the housing of the crate.

Even better, create an emergency plan for your pet now so the risk of losing it is even lower.

LifeProTips,"This LPT is sparked by a post in TIL (sorry, can't link to it here) that discusses the relationship between job happiness levels and length of commute. (See comments for a link.)

Tips about the impact of long commute times won't apply to everyone. There are people that like to have some downtime before and decompression time after work, or maybe you carpool with friends. Perhaps that's your reading time on the go-train. Lots of people don't mind a commute at all.

But if you are the type that would consider a commute to be ""part of your work day"", **here's the math**: 

* A one hour morning and evening commute works out to 440 hours per year (for a 220-day work year). 
* If you work an 8 hour day, that's another 55 days of your time spent commuting, or another 11 weeks of workdays, or two months of workdays.

That might seem to be a big thing... but after a few years it can become really tiring, especially if kids come along or your personal circumstances change.

So it's a good thing to really consider it carefully before taking a new job, if you are lucky enough that you might have any chance of an alternate job elsewhere that doesn't come with the extra time load. Sometimes there are choices for such jobs away from big cities where the commutes can be a lot gentler, if you'd be willing to move.",3183,"LPT: When seeking a new job, don't underestimate the value of the time you'll spend commuting.

I know this will sound absolutely simple and obvious but it helped me A LOT and while it is always ongoing process I invite you to really try this:

LEARN A NEW HOBBY OR SKILL - no matter how silly or hard it seems, go for it. More unique, the better. For example I picked up inline skating even though I always sucked on ice skates. None of my friends skated. But I was curious about it, started working on it and hey, I might be not the best skater in the world but I love it and it fills my head a lot thinking about it. It is something I look forward to and if I would start obssesing about some negative thoughs, I redirect myself into obsessing about my skates - how could I get better, more unique, cool?

And you know the best thing about learning new hobby? You will meet similary passionate people and they even can become your friends. Because you can talk about your hobby first and it won't be awkard but smooth as silk. 

You will naturally get confidence from this because if you managed to get better at something you sucked at first, why couldn't you improve something else in your life? Well you can and there is more in you then you think.

This is a lesson that I have learnt today after spending all weekend feeling incredibly low. I've spent over two years now purely focused on me and my happiness rather than others. A lot of this time has been more distractions than anything. Over time what I think has happened is that because I've spend little to no time doing nice things for others and not feeling appreciated by others, because I'm not helping, I've slowly begun to feel like my life is useless. You want to feel useful? Go do something kind for your neighbour, read their kids a book, buy the parents a food they like, help them fix something if you're handy. People will appreciate your help, and that makes them feel good, which makes you feel good. That positive energy you're spreading never dies.

LifeProTips,"I have been working in customer support for a while now and feel like people still don't know the basic (unwritten?) rules before calling. So here they are.

1. **We are here to help, NOT to serve.** So please address us as if you would address a normal human being who just wants to help you. We are not your loyal servants and you are not our liege.
2. **We are not all natives and that's okay.** Having a second, third or even fourth language is not very easy. So next time you call customer service and notice an accent or a grammar mistake in the agent's speech, acknowledge it in your mind and move on. There's no need for ugly comments about it. Be thankful that somebody actually took the time to learn your language so that they can be able to help you.
3. **We are not magicians.** Calling support does not equal to having your problem instantly solved. It's not a click-click-solved job. Before we can even start solving, we must make some inquiries. Sometimes it just cannot be solved by us. We either have to redirect you, ask you to solve a few things by yourself or simply let you know that the problem cannot be solved from various motives.
4. **We're not making the products/services/rules.** We are following them. It doesn't help to get angry with an agent because the product/service you bought is not good enough. We didn't produce it. We know how it works and that's what we can help you with. There are certain rules we MUST follow when handling a case, so when we tell you that we cannot do this and that, it's not because we don't feel like it. It's because we are not allowed. So please stop asking us to change the rules just for you. It's not like we're in charge.
5. **We are sometimes new and still learning.** Mostly, all agents go trough some kind of training before they start. Anyhow, that training cannot cover absolutely every aspect, so the agent will still learn even after a few months in the job. That's just how it is. If you feel that the agent is being insecure, it probably means that they have just started the job and are not very confident. Knowledge, experience and confidence only come with time. So cut us some slack, not all of us are senior agents.
6. **We're not (always) the problem.** You know that sweet, robotic like voice that most customer care agents have when they pick up? Yes, that is how we start each conversation. Most agents have the same nice attitude towards each customer that calls in. If you as a customer are already pissed off when you contact customer support and keep that attitude throughout the call, don't be so surprised that your experience sucked. Be kind, even if it's hard sometimes.
7. **We need those surveys.** They are not just for fun. Customer care agents really need the surveys, especially the good ones. The results reflect on our salary, so they do help a lot. So next time you get a survey, please take the 2 minutes to rate your experience, especially if it was a good one. And a nice little note on the side is always welcome. It makes us agents smile.
8. **We don't ignore your phone call.** There's not many things quite as frustrating as waiting in line, especially when you've been told for the last 20 minutes that you are number 1. Keep in mind that some phone calls are longer than others, agents also need and take breaks during the day, some phone lines are understaffed. So that very annoying line ""all our agents are busy at the moment"" is very true. It's not like we're just sitting at our desks and staring at that one call that's been in the queue for the last 30 minutes and laughing at it.
9. **We ask that many questions in order to help you.** It may seem that we're just asking the obvious, which we sometimes do. But we only do it in order to fully understand your problem. We cannot read your mind. We don't know the exact situation unless we ask about it. So don't be annoyed about our oh-so-obvious inquiries, just answer them.
10. **We're only human, after all. Be kind. Don't get angry.**

If you've come this far, I congratulate you. Now, I know that some agents can be rude from the very first second of the conversation. I know that not everyone tries as hard to solve a problem. But most of the time, we're nice, helpful people.

LifeProTips,"A high school teacher told me that for every 50 scholarships I apply to, I should expect to receive, at most, one. This really encouraged (scared?) me to apply for one scholarship a week in my senior year of high school, and I wish I had started sooner.

I applied to over 50 scholarships and received four. I was extremely blessed that one was a full-ride to my dream school, but I'm also glad that I had a couple others to fall back on just in case. I give campus tours now and my top tip is to try to apply for one scholarship a week in high school. Treat it like homework with deadlines - a scholarship application due every Wednesday, for example. There are so many scholarships out there and they're all extremely different. One could simply ask for your name and email, while another could require three long essays and a video. It's tough but definitely doable to submit one a week!

And don't stop when you get to college! A lot of people forget that there are so many scholarships out there for those at any step in their undergrad career. In fact, I felt like I saw more for current undergrads than high school seniors when I was in high school. I've also seen a lot of scholarships even for middle school students, so you can start even earlier! Which I realize is getting a bit r/ABoringDystopia, but it's a sad fact that it's never too early to start saving for college. Scholarships were 100% necessary for my family and if they are for yours as well, I hope this tip helps.

&#x200B;

Edit: thank you all for the comments! Just wanted to address some things:

1. This is obviously a tip for those in the United States wishing to go to college. There are many other paths to take in life and college is just one option! I wish our education system wasn't so financially INSANE but currently it is what it is. Scholarships were a necessity because of this. Go vote!!!
2. A few comments addressed that it's very difficult to apply for scholarships while having to work. I don't disagree! SAVE YOUR ESSAYS. I recycled so many essays and saved a ton of time, only had to make a couple minor edits. I think I used one essay for 15-20 different scholarships at one point. This made one a week a very doable goal!
3. The bigger scholarships took me much longer than one week to apply to - the full-ride private scholarship was a seven-month application process that required a huge application (with five essays), three letters of rec, and an interview. Obviously, it was worth it as it paid for tuition, room and board, fees, and some study abroad for four years. I know the big ones are timely but I'm telling you, they're worth it just to apply. Those who made it to the second round but not the third for my scholarship still got $4,000.

LifeProTips,"I think this may seem like a ""no-duh"" tip to some people, but this is a trap it took me way too long to figure out and I see a lot of young people fall into.

What I mean is basically this: when I was 20 and I imagined different careers for myself, I essentially pictured myself at a party of some kind telling others what my job was. I never framed the question as ""here's the kinds of duties and tasks I'll have to do.  Would I enjoy doing things like that?""  And I have many peers who became lawyers or teachers because they wanted to *be* a lawyer or teacher, then actually got into the field and realized they hate the experience of actually performing the tasks of the job.

Here's a much better way to approach it, in my opinion: I get the most fulfilment at work when I'm solving difficult problems that I know impact the business.  I don't really want anyone to report to me and I want to go to as few meetings as possible.  I also prefer to interact with other employees rather than customers.  And I like shorter projects that don't hang over my head while I'm at home.

That's just me and I found a good niche for myself that checks all those boxes, but when framed that way, I realized that you could find roles like that in many different departments in many different kinds of businesses.

LifeProTips,"So often career coaches tell people to “find what makes them thrive” or to “find a career that they love.”  This is generally bad advice for people as most individuals don’t know what it means to thrive or how to get out of the “working for a paycheck” mentality.  

Telling people to find a career doing what they love is equally useless... because many don’t know how to monetize that.

Want to help yourself (and others) find a career doing what you love?  Better advice is to find out what makes you MAD AS HELL and start there.  Why?  Because anger is passion and passion is energy.  If you care about something enough to get angry about it then it matters to you... and you’ll probably be willing to invest your time into doing something about it.  From there the challenge becomes how to monetize it (get paid for it) but at least you are starting from a place of passion vs. a paycheck.

In today’s world, especially with men, feelings of happiness are foreign and what “makes us thrive” is elusive.  Conversely, anger is an easy emotion and one we are all allowed to feel.  It’s just a different way of getting at the same thing and often offers an easier and clearer path.

LifeProTips,"Hello LPT subscribers, 

This community has existed for nine years and has more subscribers than some smaller countries have citizens. (Belgium has 11.4m) 

We find  that over time our rules have become bloated and unwieldy, making the subreddit hard to moderate and more importantly, difficult to post to. 

Each rule we have was added for a very good reason at the time. (In the sidebar there is a rule saying no tips about rubber snakes. A few years ago there was an issue with rubber snake tips.)

But over the years we have added rule after rule and never removed any and this resulted in rules creep,  a sort of nightmarish morass you guys need to navigate when you want to post here. 

This ends today. We're massively overhauling the rules, removing most of the restricted tip list and making participating here a  lot easier.

------------------------------------

**Rules that we will keep**

No tips about:

Legal, parenting, driving, tips that break the law, hygiene (including toilet), religious, relationship, troll/ joke.

And no ads. No tips that are really just recommending a product or service. No ""Get Disney+, it's great"". 

----------------------------------------

It's going to take some time to get all this arranged, especially automod is a complete disaster of rule upon rule and legacy code that requires detailed attention. During this transition some posts that are not technically against the rules anymore may still be removed. We also reserve the right to keep removing content under moderator discretion, when we feel it's not a good fit for the sub but is not codified in our existing ruleset. 

But in general we feel that this overhaul will make it much simpler and enjoyable to participate here.

Full disclosure - I am a 35 year old ~~white~~ male who does not own a medical degree. I am not the Vagina whisperer. I am not an ovarian expert. I am not other reproductive-organ based titles. I'm just a dude passing on information that was given to me by someone with apocalyptic cramps that has helped me help almost every significant other, since. If you have a vagina, I assume you know how it works. I'm talking to the other people like me that were raised in the middle of nowhere, and NO ONE talked about the reproductive cycle or female organs. I'm sick of all the ignorance floating around and I think we need to normalize talking about this stuff because it's important.

Let's streamline something and get it out of the way, real quick. This is not the end-all be-all solution for everyone. Your go-to should be providing your significant other with things like heating pads, water bottles, cuddles, lower back rubs or whatever else they want. Their own internal organs are trying to punch them in the lungs. You need to ask before you do this because depending on the person's sensitivity, it could hurt worse. Periods are often different even in the same person.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here's a scribble that I stole from google images and exacted my mad skills in Microsoft Paint, on. [https://i.imgur.com/q2BZsxa.png](https://i.imgur.com/q2BZsxa.png)

People today are being diagnosed with all kinds of amazing and awful conditions that make the already ever-so-fun aspect of having a uterus even more of a potential nightmare. I've had several partners in my life that had severe, often debilitating cramps during their cycle due to things like PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) or Endometriosis. It can be brutal for them, and I'm tired of not talking about it. This tiny thing that I'm about to teach you could make your significant other's time of the month - or week or year or whatever their 'cycle' might be doing - infinitely more bearable.

That's a simple, inoffensive, line-art drawing of a portion of a body. See that red part? That's right over the uterus. During their periods and often outside of their ScHeDuLe depending on hormones and other factors, the muscles around it cramp, HARD. Often, things as strong as hydrocodone won't be strong enough to even slow the pain down, and Mydol is a fking joke. This is constant, repeated charley-horse of the muscle group that surrounds a delicate internal organ and it sucks so much more than that makes it sound. Those muscles are flexing and releasing like a large man's fist during a heart attack - aggressively and without reason.

**Sometimes in these cases, pressure can provide immediate relief. Ask your partner if you can try applying pressure to see if it helps. If you get the green light, all you have to do is rest your hand or arm directly over that red spot, and apply firm but gentle pressure. That's it - that's the whole thing. Apply a little pressure - you're not trying to beat it up for hurting your significant other. You know how when your muscles are sore, they like to be rubbed? Same thing.  Just apply firm pressure like you're giving someone a hug. Not a bear hug; a normal one. If they want more pressure, believe me, they'll ask for it. The counter-pressure and heat will relieve an unbelievable amount of pressure and pain. You don't necessarily need to massage - the cramps will do that for you. If it works, the relief is often IMMEDIATE.**

*Because'Why don't they do it themselves?' a common question, I'm sure someone can do this to themselves. My point is it can feel a lot better and the person feels a lot less alone if you offer to do it for them. Also it's probably pretty uncomfortable to do it yourself in a lot of cases.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR -   Rest hand or arm with slight pressure on or across the red spot highlighted in this diagram. (just above the vagina, where pubic hair would typically grow.)  [https://i.imgur.com/q2BZsxa.png](https://i.imgur.com/q2BZsxa.png)

P.S. Please feel free to repost the crap out of this. I don't care about credit. Downvote this into oblivion, that's fine, I don't care about the shiny internet points. I care that a LOT of people deal with crippling reproductive issues, and mostly they just suck it up and shut up because half the population can't understand what they're going through, and a fair chunk of the half that could doesn't believe them because 'well it never happened to me, so you're wrong'. Help your people.

LifeProTips,"Studies show people tend to eat, not hydrate, in situations where they’re just thirsty. The body has trouble differentiating between mild hunger and dehydration due to the subtly of the symptoms.

Staying hydrated has other benefits beyond preventing snacking's excess calories, such as assisting digestion or reducing bloating. The water in your stomach may also communicate to your brain a greater feeling of fullness, and reduce your cravings.

However, the best and most obvious way to stop unnecessary snacking is to stop buying snacks you cannot resist eating. You can also store them in hard-to-reach places to make yourself think twice before going to grab it.

LifeProTips,"Students everywhere are being told to move out of the dorms and go back home for the rest of the semester due to the virus. After talking with lots of friends, the common denominator in our conversations was always that people are feeling very suffocated living with their parents again for the same reason: **boundaries** . 

Wether you’re in grade school or college this probably applies to you. It can be hard transitioning into living with family members that you have to answer to again after being on your own for a while and developing your own living habits as an adult. 

So here is the tip: Make a list of things you need from your new long term yet temporary living space, and ask your parents to make a similar list of what they expect from you. This is where you will be learning for the rest of the semester potentially, so ask yourself questions like:


- Do you need quiet hours for studying? If so, when?
- Do you need a list of chores to do, or a way of communicating that you’re contributing around the house? 
- Do you need alone time? 
- Do you need a proper work space?

Have a gentle conversation with your parents about these things BEFORE there is a fallout. Personally I was having a problem with my mom asking me to do chores when I just sat down to begin my work, and it would throw me off for the whole day, especially considering everyone is stuck at home during quarantine.

**EDIT** : damn, so many of y’all are saying stuff along the lines of family’s like this don’t exist. I’m sorry if you come from a family where you can’t have conversations like this, it’s worth a try though dude.  I had to have had this convo with my parents last night and they were understanding. Of course there were some things we didn’t agree on but the end result of a compromise is really the goal, we both needed to **communicate.** I don’t mind doing chores or anything to help the house, in fact I’m even cleaner than my family. 

I mentioned the main problem I had was being asked to do chores when I just sat down to start my work, which is true but I wasn’t talking about stuff like taking out the trash, **I meant like my mom asking me to pressure wash the fucking driveway all afternoon and assuming I have time for that.

LifeProTips,"This particular ""trick"" often lures in young and unsuspecting workers. Instead of hiring you as an employee, an employer will <wink, wink> say that you'll be hired as an independent contractor ""for tax purposes."" Maybe you assume it's legit and they're using a loophole, or...? But the job pays better than you'd hoped (or maybe it doesn't), so you take it.

At first, things seem even better than you expected. They're not taking ANYTHING out of your check. Yay, right? Wrong. In fact, it's wrong in (at least) three parts: 

1 - Those taxes (FICA, etc.) that would usually be taken out of an employee's check are still owed. And you owe them, not your employer. You will be in for a big shock when you do your taxes.

2 - Not only do you owe the usual taxes that you would normally pay as an employee, but you owe *additional* taxes as a ""self-employed"" worker. These are the taxes that an employer pays to the IRS on behalf of its employees. (These tax payments don't show up on an employee's paycheck at all.) This is the money that Mr. or Ms. Wink-Wink is saving themselves by paying you on a 1099.

· Turn on ALL lights and/or go outside if possible (this step can be used to get out of bed).

\-2. \*\*Body\*\*

· Drink some water. Take a multivitamin (B12, Omega 3, and Vitamin D are also good). Even if unnecessary, this can be a good placebo. Eat if hungry.

\-3. \*\*Hygiene\*\*

· Shower, shave, brush teeth, put on fresh clean clothes. (Bonus: clip nails, makeup, pamper yourself)

\-4. \*\*Clean\*\*

· Give it 5 minutes. Throw away trash, do dishes, do laundry, wipe surfaces, vacuum etc.

\-5. \*\*Exercise\*\*

· Just walk. Jogging is better if possible. Or, do yard work.

\-6. \*\*Socialize\*\*

· Small, 1-3 people you are comfortable with. Just call a good friend or family member.

\-7. \*\*Community service\*\*

· Pick up trash in your neighborhood or help someone in need. Write someone a note or friendly online message.

Edit: As a few commenters pointed out, it is better to put the money you would be spending on making these payments into savings and paying down your loans before interest rates increase. This gives you the benefit of whatever your savings account gives you in interest.

LifeProTips,"I'm 18 months clean from stimulants and I'll show you how addiction starts:

1- you overcome the initial fear and try drugs when someone offers you. You don't feel cravings after and you can't understand how some people do it 2-3 days in a row. Also, TV says it's highly addictive. But you feel no cravings and no strong hangover. You think TV is exaggerating or you must be immune or something.

2- Since everything went ok, you'll say yes the next time you're offered a fix. Again, you won't feel cravings after, or any strong hangover. The feeling that you're in control grows stronger.

3- the number of times you'll repeat step 2 to start having strong cravings and hangovers depends on the person. It can be 4 weeks or 4 months. That's when you start lying to yourself that you're under control.

4- drugs will lose their appeal, but it doesn't matter. you're hooked forever.",1711,LPT: most people don't feel strong cravings or a strong hangover after doing drugs a few times.

LifeProTips,"If they are willing, it is smart to verify your Grandparents and older Parents’ Verizon and Comcast bills. There are a number of unnecessary services added to senior citizens’ bills that they typically don’t know about (or don’t understand). There is a good chance you can save them $25 - $30 a month.

My story: we bought my wife’s parents a new television for Christmas. When installing it I noticed that the Verizon cable box they were using was over 15 years old (meaning they don’t have HDMI output). I asked to see how much they were paying for the rental and found some extra line items on their bill. 

1. They are paying $12.99 a month for a 15+ year old cable box while still paying $90 a month for the “Ultimate HD“ package.

2. They are paying $10.99 for the “Inside Wire Maintenance Plan”, even though Verizon did not install the cable in their house (they will just fix it if something goes wrong, but not replace wiring). They have been charging them for 10 years.

3. Verizon only locally  operates under “Authorized Retailers” and cannot provide equipment or help with equipment without authorization from Verizon. We have waited on the phone for over an hour to get someone on the line to get an upgrade.

Due to the _massive_ volume of tips that are being submitted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are creating a single post for you to add your tips to.

From this point forward, we will be removing submissions having to do with the crisis, that appear outside of this thread.

Additionally, we will be removing items IN the thread that are dangerous and/or demonstrably false.  Misinformation can, and does, get people hurt (or worse)

------------------------------------------

Editorial note:

Covid-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the WHO after having torn through Asia, Europe, The US, etc.  There is no cure.  There is no vaccine.  There is no natural immunity.  This is something that will ultimately touch everyone's lives in ways that the common flu never does.

I've seen many posts & comments attempting to diminish the severity of the situation (""It's just like the flu!"" ""Flu kills 68000 and this has killed 20 people!"" ""It's a hoax!"") and some things that are clearly panic - No folks, the Pandemic shits aren't a thing and toilet paper won't save you.  Wearing masks is for sick people, not the healthy ones.  Both ends of this spectrum are equally dangerous and should be avoided.

The current mantra, of the medical community, is to ""flatten the curve.""  This essentially means that taking some common sense steps, to limit the amount of people flooding the medical system, are the goal.  The current medical system (in the US at least) is not equipped to handle the sheer volume of people that will be looking for help in the near future, but over a lengthened timeline it is better equipped to give people a better chance at good care (flatten the curve instead of a spike).

To help do this, practice the following:

1. Wash your hands frequently.  Just running/rubbing your hands under warm, soapy water for just 20 or 30 seconds has amazing results and will go a long way to insulating you from infection.  (Really, folks... how many of you haven't been washing your hands before? eew)

2. Avoid touching your face, nose, eyes, mouth with unclean hands.  It should go without saying, that if you haven't sanitized your hands that you should avoid exposing sensitive areas to potential infection

3. Avoid large gatherings/groups.  This point may (and probably will) be enforced by your local governments.  Transmission of this, and all, virus is facilitated in large groups.  Putting yourself in the middle of 100's or 1000's of potentially infected people is a recipe for bad health.  Pay attention to the news and wait for the medical community to sound the all clear.

4. Practice social distancing (related to point 3.).  Love and life in the time of corona blows for people that crave contact :(  Try to keep some distance (6 ft recommended) in between you and others.  This simple step can help to keep yourself (and others) from getting infected.  

5. Stay home if you are sick.  This one is the hardest for those without vacation time or those that will be economically impacted with a loss of work.  Often times, the people that are least likely to have any stored sick leave or finances, are the ones that are mercilessly forced to work while sick and ultimately exposing others.  Do you part to help these people, and everyone around you, by not exposing them to your sickness.  This is an especially dire situation for the elderly as this impacts them in a massively disproportionate way

6. If you are sick, and think you need to go to the emergency room for treatment, please ***call ahead*** to find out if they have any specific direction for you.  If you do have COVID-19, you may very well infect all staff and a waiting room full of people if you don't follow proper procedure.  

Please take care of yourselves and be mindful that your actions can, and will, impact others.

I look forward to seeing what everyone comes up with that can be useful during this time :)  (I also welcome additions and corrections to the above list)

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I found this out because it actually was true in my case I had a 14 month employment gap after college so I could care for my grandfather who was dying from brain cancer. that gap has always hurt me when I explained it at an interview recently the interviewers entire opinion of me changed in her eyes that gap initially meant I was lazy and coasted for a year after college and once I told her I was caring for my grandfather she realized that her perception of the situation was wrong. After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. 

It's a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can't ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero.

Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me.

Edit2: So this blew up and I've seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I'm going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. 

I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. 

That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don't be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can't get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years. If you traveled for a year after college summarize what skills you acquired; you can adapt to new environments easily, you work well with a diverse team, etc. If you provided end of life care you learned a lot of responsibility you deal with stress and difficult conditions well. If you spent your 2 years unemployed sniffing glue in your moms basement I can't help you besides telling you to lie but as a manager I just want to know that you did something valuable with your time.

In fewer words don't leave your employment gap up to my imagination I'm cynical enough to fill it in with glue sniffing or prison. 

Also just to answer this line of inquiry that I have seen definitely leave rehab out I have 3 other people just as qualified as you sitting on my desk that didn't just tell me that they (used to) have an impulse control problem.

edit 2: I kept getting asked questions about ambulance and I knew there was something I wanted to remember. I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it's not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it's really supposed to be kept by you.  

 I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate ""tip,"" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt.

So I thought I'd share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing & collections agency.

**Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a ""Healthcare in the US is broken"" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn't the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post.

If you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I'll say ""hospitals"" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes.

***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:***

**Your debt goes in stages:**

* Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They're nice when it's still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there's no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL!
* Bad Debt **Contractors** \- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work
* Bad Debt **Purchasers** \- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt.

There are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don't know if there's an official term for each type, but I'll make up my own.

* **Contract** \- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount.
* And **Purchasers** \- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies.

***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:***

* **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it's medical debt.**

\--> Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it's a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn't pay your portion, or if you didn't have insurance AND didn't attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so.

* **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.**

\--> Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it's expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it's the last resort after a certain time frame, but ""Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid"" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren't resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it's common.

* **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.**

\--> Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit & stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue.

On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don't go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don't expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.

If it's a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn't worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we'd always send it if we couldn't convince the client to pay in installments. It's worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.

You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your 'proof of debt' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won't list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.

That's not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don't want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!

* **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they've got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!**

\--> Bitch, please. They know it's yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn't they? The only thing you're doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.

* **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights**  
or  
**Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn't authorize them to collect the debt, and they're violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!**

\--> Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They're not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn't know why you went.

* **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.**

\--> Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don't report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There's no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don't report to credit on THIS account, if we didn't. But then we'd give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don't assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.

* **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!**

\--> Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can't call/write/etc you, that doesn't stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.

It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom's car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility's network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).

* **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!**

\--> In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it's you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they're calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it's your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it's name/address/year of birth. The agency's lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what's on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it's for your protection.

You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state ""collections"" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep's name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don't know if they're legit. If they are legit, they'll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they'll resend a letter if you tell them you'll pay, etc.

Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it's a scam. That's the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).

* **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!**

\--> *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer's contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it's not foolproof.

If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.

If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we're not going to call back...but that doesn't always stop the process.

I don't know the time frame on that because I wasn't in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.

**LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:**

* ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It's always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.
* ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you'd like. That being said, it doesn't automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you're making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.
* ***""This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.""*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you're in collections. Like, duh.  
They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don't miss a payment. But don't think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they're more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.

**MAGIC WORD:**  
**I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality **if the D-word is said, it's a dispute.**

Good, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn't receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure.

Bullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I'm racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don't want to pay, my insurance should have paid this.

But again if you say **DISPUTE** \- they can ask more questions to see if it's a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you're disputing it and they don't immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate.

**THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:**  
\-If you say dispute and they don't stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA.  
\-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA.  
\-If they say it's a **debt** before confirming it's you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go.

**What to do on every medical collections call:**  
\-Get the name of the agency and the representative you're speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on.  
\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it's a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?  
\-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over?  
\-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn't clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it's in Bad Debt.  
\-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they'll only use those kindnesses if you're not a douche.

UnethicalLifeProTips,My freshman year of college I ended up sleeping through my morning classes (2 classes) twice in a row. They were strict classes which didn’t allow more than two unexcused absences. I went to my campus’s health services office and said I hit my head that weekend and was having concussion symptoms. They checked my reflexes and said I probably had a minor concussion and excused me from class for 3 days.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"My dad sucks. He beat my mother growing up, left me with a pedophile (it ended the way you’d expect) and constantly villafied my mother growing up. I was raised by my mother and have lived with him a year out of my life. That year was split up between him losing custody because he started drinking again (he is and was a huge alcoholic), then me moving in with him in adulthood only for him to kick me out (in 95 degree weather without any warning whatsoever) in an attempt to manipulate me into letting him sell my parrot. I tried time and time again to have a legitimate relationship with the man but I’ve never been successful. 

Now, I don’t hate people because they’re alcoholics. It’s a tough addiction And I applaud anyone who tries to get over it. My father, however, is a mean drunk. Very mean. He punches holes in the walls, disowns me and reowns me, tells blatant lies about my past and tries to guilt me into feeling sorry for him. 

After not speaking to him for a year, I’ve just heard that he may be in liver failure. He has two houses, one on mortgage and another he owns outright. I would like to inherit them because owning a house would be a huge step up in my life at my age (22). 

My father supposedly has narcissistic personality disorder, though I’m not sure if that’s diagnosed or not. If it isn’t, he definitely shows symptoms. Here’s my request: 

How can I contact him again and rekindle a relationship without him being suspicious? I’m not the manipulative type most of the time and already feel guilty considering doing this. My concern is that I’m sure my dad would put something in a Will saying I don’t get anything. I’d like to be on his good side. At this point he’s ruined my life once and tried to twice, and beyond the requisite “he’s my father” I don’t care all that much about him. I don’t want him to die, but if he is going to, I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to get a house.


Edit: so I’ve been talking to the girlfriend. He’s gone batshit, more so than I thought. He’s drinking even more than before, trying to start fights with the other roommate, and then calling the police on him when he doesn’t do anything. He’s told the girlfriend she’s not getting anything because she spoke to my mother (not even told my mother, just spoke to her). 

I’ve sent a message about him being sick, but deleted it before he received it (checkmark wasn’t filled in). It said “delete for you” though so I’m worried he’s seen it. If he does and flips out even more at the girlfriend I’m not sure what I should do.

Edit #2: I’ve decided not to contact him.

I have Aspergers. For those of you who think I’m evil I know that sounds like a dumbass excuse but I have a reason for telling you this. As much as you may think I’m a liar, I have never intentionally manipulated anyone in my adult life. I’ve always tried to be kind to the people I like and nice to those who hurt me. I came on hoping people who knew better could tell me how to get my dad to forgive me for whatever he thinks I’ve done and begin to value me again. Many of you delivered on just that or offered other advice on the matter. I thank you all, but I don’t believe I am mentally capable of pulling this off. 

 My social ineptitude was showing because I didn’t know that this post would upset so many people. I know now that it’s upsetting to many of you, though I’m not sure I understand why. I’ve seen so many people lie to each other about how they felt about others then hurt them, I never intended to hurt my father in the scheme I had. If my plan necessitated a “Ha-ha! Gotcha!” Moment or a piece of revenge, I’d never have considered it. To me, it meant he died happy and I got something out of it too. Definitely not selfless, definitely the most sleazy thing I’ve ever considered doing, but not something I thought would get me sent hate mail. 

I will admit that I still don’t feel as guilty for having wanted to do this as many of you expect me to. I don’t understand why it makes me a terrible person. I thought feigning interests and making people like you was commonplace, even if I’ve never tried it. I feel guilty for considering lying, but I feel guilty for telling coworkers I have plans when they ask me to cover their shift. I understand death and him being my father adds another factor, but I don’t get how it turns it from unethical to “fuck you”. I wasn’t trying to screw him over and didn’t see that as a possibility.

Maybe it’s because I never got to have the cliche father/daughter relationship. I think all of you are reading this as a person trying to do this to their dad, not the sort of relationship I have with him. I found that most people who said they have a parent with NPD were rooting for me. 

I have confirmation that he is not senile. My father is 50 with no known history of dementia in the family. I spoke to him a year ago last time he disowned me and he was fine mentally, save for having suddenly decided that he hated me. 
“He’s gone batshit” just means his drunken antics have increased. He isn’t doing anything to make me think he’s gone insane so much as he’s pissed at the world and lashing out at everyone around him. I spoke to his girlfriend and she confirmed he’s coherent, just drunk and acting the way he does when he’s drunk and has no one else to attack. If I thought for a second he was senile I’d have taken much more issue with lying to him. 

That said, many of you were asking why I wanted the houses if there was so much baggage with my dad. I will be honest and say that I struggle with adult life despite doing well at school. I’m 22 and I don’t have many of the skills I should at my age. I don’t have a credit score and every attempt to get one has been thwarted. I don’t see myself ever being successful enough at life to get a house of my own unless I got lucky. I saw this as my only chance to own a home, even if I sold the mortgaged one and bought a smaller home elsewhere. It would be difficult to figure out but I have a relative who does real estate who could’ve helped me. Maybe I’d have had to live with it the rest of my life, but I might be living a much better life if I had. 


TLDR; I was asking how to get my father (who disowned me because of his NPD) to like me again so I had a chance of getting an inheritance. I have decided not to contact him due in part to my belief that I don’t have the social skills to do such a thing and because I didn’t understand the social implications of posting this.


FINAL UPDATE: thank you to everyone who was understanding.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489589-senate-rejects-gop-attempt-to-change-unemployment-benefits-in-stimulus-bill

The new stimulus bill provides $600/week in unemployment benefits, in addition to existing benefits which vary by state, but usually amount to roughly half of your previous wages.

For example, in Illinois, if you make $52,000 a year, that's $1k a week. Get laid off, you get $600 + $471 a week in unemployment benefits= $1071 a week.

Now, you have to be clever. If you get fired for misconduct, you're not eligible for unemployment. So you can't just start screaming profanities to get fired.

Instead, start talking to coworkers about your salary and ask theirs. Start encouraging coworkers to form a union, in earshot of your boss.

It is illegal to fire a worker for those reasons, but it will make them try to find a way to lay you off, such as bad job performance(which doesn't kill eligibility for unemployment). If they try to dispute your claim, just threaten to sue them for violating right to unionize. They'll back off.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Edit preface: Didn't expect this to get any attention. Some of you are taking this *way* to seriously. This is meant to be humorous. I'm not actually suggesting anyone do this. Nothing in this sub should actually be taken as advice. It's comedy people.

I was reading a post earlier on how owners of AirBnB are actually allowed to install cameras in common areas as long as they state this int he description. In the comments, someone was talking about how they have found hidden cameras in their rooms while travelling for business and staying in very nice, expensive and busy Hotels.

Based on this and other comments, it occurs very frequently.

A hidden cam will cost you about $50 online. One of these, a screw driver and an air vent, thermostat, lamp or whatever and you're golden; you could even just tape it under a desk.

If you called the hotel staff in and threw a fit, they will probably do just about anything to prevent you from leaving a bad review or getting the press or police involved.

Free room, upgraded room, meal & drink vouchers, you name it.

Should probably file down the serial number and buy a SD card with cash somewhere local to really sell the thing, just in case. But in all likelihood, they want to sweep the whole thing under the rug. It's probably \*actually\* happened before. The hotel staff may even be doing it in other rooms.

Your goal is not to actually get police involved, just to threaten that, or other legal action. 

Probably wouldn't work in an AirBnB setting, so stick with big name hotels.

Edit: To everyone saying that they will catch you with their own hidden cameras: so what?

That's the whole point. You're relying on the fact that they probably are aware of hidden cameras in the hotel. They're not going to give themselves up to out you. They'll be very happy to give you free stuff so you go away.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Honestly this could even be a LPT, but since it involves dishonesty I guess it goes here.

I interned at a company that bonded felons so they could get jobs (it's like insurance, if the felon steals the bonding company covers it).

Many high end jobs, even 6 figure salaried positions; don't background check. Almost all jobs however do ask if you're a felon.

**By checking the felon box, you're likely not even going to get an interview**. It's just the truth. Felons are the only class not protected federally by work equality laws. If you owned a business, would you take the felon or the equally qualified non felon?

**However, by NOT checking that box - You can get the interview, you can get the job**, and if it happens to come up later; you have a better chance of staying on board if they like you/are happy with your performance. Worst case, you get fired; which is no worse than not getting the job in the first place.

Government jobs, jobs involving children, nursing/medicine -- all background check.

Most business/corporate jobs however, don't (they may SAY they do, and they may ASK, but they usually don't actually check). Office/Admin/Sales positions rarely check. **I have a friend who made 370K last year as a Pharma Rep/Saleswoman for a huge Pharma Co. and she is a convict.**

Lastly, the jobs that usually DO hire felons, are doing it for a huge tax break; and will likely pay minimum wage (fast food, custodial, etc). Good luck supporting yourself with that salary. Also, a GOOD job willing to hire you knowing you're a felon, will slash your salary because they know you don't have a lot of options.

**Edit:** For people wondering about my friend, she doesn't work with or sell to doctors or hospitals, she brokers the deals that give the manufacturer a contract to produce the pill/tablet. These contracts are often tens of millions of dollars. She works for the company that creates the formula for the drug, then sells the manufacturing rights.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"This is mainly unethical because you'd be technically lying by omission. Also because it would be considered so by many, who got scammed by the college system fairytale one way or the other, and are now salty about anyone more clever than them (also butthurt about us earning 5 times more than them with less papers, but now that's just rubbing it in...).

I have been on many (30+) interviews, nobody ever asked me to show any paper degree (or high school papers etc). Ever. Not even once. That shit simply does not happen in a real IT company ran by competent professionals (those which care about your actual knowledge of technology and experience). You need to know your shit, yes, but no need to bring any dumb papers.

Now I am so used to this fact I simply mention the name of the college as a one liner in CV between the years of high school and getting employed at the company I started to work for while I was in college. Technically I'm not lying, it is simply implied that I wasted some years doing ""college stuff"", which is true (and most people got some degree doing it for that amount of time, so I *might* too, nobody ever cared to ask).

In reality I've been to comp. sci. college for 3 years, then simply stopped going, not wanting to waste 1.5 more years for their useless degree, as what they teach was and is completely useless. I was working remotely full time at the same time and had first hand experience in what kind of tech is actually really needed and used in a real world business environment.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I learned a little trick (after being conned out of my deposit multiple times): deposit generally is one month of rent here (the Netherlands). And here they also tend to keep the deposit for some bullshit reason. So I never payed the last month of my lease.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I learned this when I worked as a server/bartender at a neighborhood bar and grill that was next to a hotel. A group of construction workers would come in for lunch and dinner several times during the two weeks they were in town on a job.

The hotel had mini fridges and microwaves in their rooms, and the foreman would frequently buy up sandwich makings and snacks for his guys, And even make and package sandwiches for lunches while they were on the site. 

He would tip me very well to save copies of checks throughout my day. Any check without alcohol and not over a certain amount on it and he would pay me $1 per check. It was nothing for me to do it for him, I would just print an extra copy and keep it in my book until he came in to collect them the next time. 


He told me he was free to pretty much buy his guys anything he wanted at his discretion and expense it, so he would turn all the checks in at the end of the job and the company wrote him a fat check.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"To make a long story short, I'm a casual (not full time or part time - day to day) employee who has a verbal agreement to work a full time schedule. Though I have a verbal agreement to work everyday, I have been told I can take days off if I need to.

One of my shifts this week will be absolutely shit (in terms of the behaviour of those I have to manage, I know what it is in advance), but another workplace has offered me a shift on that day with possibly better conditions for more money.

I need a believable excuse that will allow me to take that day off but also allow for a credible cover story if I am questioned about going to work at the other place. The reason that I could be questioned is that the two workplaces are not too far away from each other and there are families that send their children to both of these workplaces -- I don't want to be in a situation where I get ""oh, we saw u/lana_del_reymysterio today"" and that gets back to the wrong people somehow.

My current idea was say I can't come in on that day due to needing to go to x appointment. My cover story idea if questioned is appointment got cancelled day of, figured too late to say I can work now, got a call from other workplace saying to come in so I accepted.

&#x200B;

EDIT: It's not a question of if I can take a day off as I can and don't need to give a reason. However, I will need a backup plan (cover story) in case they do find out I was working somewhere else instead. 

EDIT 2: The first workplace cannot give me full time at this stage as they have no positions to offer. What my role is there is to full in for people and cover their release time (short periods/breaks from work) or days off. They can also not offer me money as all salaries and wages in this field of work are fixed (while fixed, they vary at different places).

TLDR: Locked in until April. Can take any day off I want without issue (unpaid).

UnethicalLifeProTips,"There will be exceptions for SURE so look into it. Especially with engineering, etc. It's just a small tip to make the admissions person think you are a little less risky of a candidate if you align your strengths with your ""interests"".

Edit: Since this got some traction I want to add to those of you new to college, a lot of universities  have minimum quotas they need to meet for different majors and many will have their college advisors really push you hard to get into something like a language major or something else you didn't really want to do so they can justify keeping those programs. Just be aware of that and stick to what you really want to try out in the end. My other advice is - if they let you- go in undecided as a major (once you gain admission). It's better to take a little bit of everything freshman year and figure out what you like because almost anything you take your first year will count towards graduation. However if you decide on something immediately and you tailor your first semesters around one particular major and end up changing later, it could extend your college stay and it will be tougher emotionally.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Let me clarify - canI use my spouses NON-CURRENT student loan to pay off my CURRENT student loan?

Maybe this is a rare circumstance and forgive me for my ignorance. 

My spouse is going to graduate school. I finished my masters and am making payments on my student loans (17K). My thought is since my current loan is accruing interest now and my spouse’s is not why not take out more in their student loans, pay mine off, and continue to make payments towards their student loan. 

TLDR:
My student loan: 17K accruing interest

Spouses (current grad student): 5K no interest until 6 months after graduation - can get 2X the amount needed for school in student loans. 

Solution? - consolidate both loans using Spouse’s student loan and thus utilizing no interest aspect. 

Anyone know if this would work? In theory this seems like a no brainer but feel like it is too good to be true. Thanks for any responses!

EDIT: Well fuck me. After doing more due diligence (and many smarter people’s comments), turns out that the spouses loan accrues interest immediately not like I was thinking.

Third, they did allow students to bring labeled water bottles to exams, and our water bottles still mostly had regular paper labels, so with the small font of the same color as the original, no one suspected a thing.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I used to do this in college when I was poor and starving. Go to any major chain restaurant website and head to the ‘Contact Us’ section of the site. Carefully email them about your horrible experience with your family, significant other or friend. Tell them how disappointed you are because it was a special occasion and the horrible experience has lead you to never want to eat there again. Make sure to tell them you’ve never had these kinds of issues before and are very disappointed things turned out this way. 

Leave a good email and phone number with them because in my experience someone may call you to follow up. As long as you can stick to your story and detail what outraged you they will offer a GC as compensation to come back and try again with them to make it up. A week or 2 later the GC will arrive in the mail and the restaurant and staff are non the wiser when you use it. 

Here are some tips I’ve learned when doing this:

1) Never give your server an actual name. Don’t get anyone in real trouble. I always say they weren’t wearing a name tag and because it was busy you can’t remember their name. The name tag thing usually irks them more. Just give a basic one off description. 

2) Never say you paid with a credit card. They will search the the transaction logs to see if your name matches any CC receipts. Always say you paid in cash. They can’t track it. 

3) You want to tell them the food was cold, undercooked, or late. Refills were almost non existent. I always say the server was hard to track down. 

4) Keep your party size small. I always say 2-4 people. Make it bigger at your own risk. 

5) Always tell them it was a Friday or Saturday. Busy days are usually met with tons of people and it’s harder to keep track. 

6) Know your menu. Make sure you know what everyone in your party ate. Make it very common and popular menu items. If you get too crazy expensive then the I used cash option looks odd. 

7) Be prepared to speak to someone. They do call to apologize and hear more about your story. Not all of them (chili’s doesn’t fucking care) but some do. They give a more personal touch. 

8) Do your restaurant research. Some chain restaurants fall under the same parent company so they all have the same complaint department. For example, Olive Garden is owned by Darden Co. They also own Long Horn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s Kitchen, Capital Grill etc. you don’t want to do this to more than one of the same restaurants under the bigger parent company. You will get caught quick. Just google: who owns X restaurant and see everything. 

9) Wait some time before doing this repeatedly to the same restaurant. I usually wait a year, but you can proceed at your own risk. 

10) Enjoy your free corporate meal or sell them for straight cash. Win win. 



***Someone asked how much they usually send you and I can tell you this much***

Olive Garden - $50

Chili’s - Varies. Once I received five $5 vouchers and once a $25 GC

Red Lobster - $50

Macaroni Grill - $30

Claim Jumper (May be regional) - $50

UnethicalLifeProTips,"You sleep days, so.... you rent a large storage room at one of those self-storage places.  

Many of those places allow you to use them as Mancaves or makeshift workshops to hang out in all day. You just gotta keep the door open while you do it. 

 So you bring in stuff that hides your sleeping area. You can make walls out of shelving units filled with boxes to keep any management/nosey employees from easily finding you. Make it a maze/and or block their way with boxes so they cannot easily get to you. Buy a motion-detecting driveway alert or doorway alert that has an alert tone that is the sound of  a phone ringing (I own one that does this) to wake you up when someone enters your unit. 

Then you can jump up and act like you are reorganizing or any activity that isnt sleeping.  

You could also make a completely hidden sleeping area that no one can find .... like a large box you get inside to sleep. You can lock it from the inside. 

-----------------------

Another idea (while I'm at it).... make a deal with another person that roughly looks like you that works days so you can alternate your sleeping in the unit. You go to sleep during the day... your partner leaves and locks you in until he comes back from his job after his shift, and you switch places. You lock him in while you go to work. Note: be sure to have a power tool in the unit that can easily cut you out in case of an emergency. Both wear the same outfit when coming and going so it appears as if the same person comes in for a 20 minutes or so and then leaves. So any employees seeing you (or watching security camera footage) will think you are the same person. 

This would be ideal for places that just have ridiculously high rent prices.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Hey everyone. My friend is a police dispatcher and he wanted to share some tips with us because his boss is a dick. Pretty much every police department uses radios to communicate, and not many agencies use encrypted systems.

**""How do I get set up?""**

If you live in a somewhat large city, chances are there might be a live feed of your area's radio traffic already being streamed. In that case, all you need is an app on your phone.

If a live stream isn't available, you can get a radio scanner for about $150 (for an analog system) to $300 (for newer digital systems). Not sure which one you need? Go to [Radio Reference](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/) and put your zip code in the search box. It will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area. Click on the name of the agency, and look under ""Mode"". If it has ""A"" it's analog, ""D"" is digital, and ""M"" is mixed (use a digital scanner). If you see the letter ""E"", that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner won't work (see below for a workaround). A digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well. There are programming guides online, but many new scanners are plug and play: you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself. 

**""So what can I do with a scanner?""**

Lots of things, ranging from harmless to borderline-illegal:

* Listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them.

* Set your radio in ""close call"" mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby. That means there's generally a cop, paramedic, or firefighter nearby.

* Get the scoop on what's going on in the neighborhood.

* Use it when committing a crime. You can hear the police get dispatched, so you know when it's time to leave. You can also hear if they're going to a call on the other side of town, so use that to your advantage.

**""I hear them talking, but I can't understand them. What do I do?""**

If it's just them talking too fast, you'll get used to it. Trust me. It's easy to develop a ""radio ear"" in as little as a few hours of listening.

Many departments use ""10-codes"" which are used to shorten messages and provide some (very weak) security. Many of you already know a few, such as 10-4 for ""understood"". 10-4 is the only universal 10-code, but there are some semi-standardized lists you can find [here](http://copradar.com/tencodes/index.html). If those codes aren't the same ones used near you, look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department, they tend to be similar to local 10-codes.

You don't even *need* to know what the 10-codes are for certain crimes. When a call is dispatched, the address is almost always given in an uncoded format. For example, we might say:

> All units, 10-35 in progress at 123 Main Street. Responding units acknowledge.

So if you're breaking into the house at 123 Main Street, you don't need to know that a 10-35 is a burglary, you just know that the cops are on their way and it's time to get out of there. Also listen for alert tones (such as a long, steady beep or a ""wee-woo"" warble tone) that often indicate a serious crime in progress.

If you hear static or can't understand much at all, you might need a good antenna. Amazon sells a decent car roof antenna for about $15 and it's well worth it. Range depends on the antenna you get and the system they're using, but for me is generally about 20 miles from the nearest repeater.

**My local department encrypts their radio channels. What can I do?""**

An encrypted system isn't the end of the world. If you plan on using a radio for... less than legal reasons, then it's easy to steal one. Call the cops for a routine theft report or something, and have someone else steal the handheld radio from the car. Dispatch can remotely deactivate a radio, but we very rarely do unless you transmit on it and disrupt our operations. The NYPD has been having issues with stolen radios and they don't even encrypt most of their channels.

**Anything I should be careful about?**

Yes:

* A few states (such as Florida and New York) prohibit the use of a scanner in a vehicle, unless you're a licensed amateur radio operator (which is an easy license to get).

* Using a scanner during a crime can get you extra charges, depending on where you live.

* Dispatch has no way of knowing if you're using a scanner, but officers will often let us know if there are scanners located at an address so we can update our records.

* There are other ways for officers and dispatch to communicate. They will often relay sensitive information (such as a criminal history) via phone or an instant messenger system.

**TL;DR** Get a police radio scanner. They have many uses if you want to hear what the cops are doing.",319,"ULPT: Carry a police radio scanner in your car, it can come handy",0.94,1574997551.0,e38vai,t3_e38vai,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/e38vai/ulpt_carry_a_police_radio_scanner_in_your_car_it/,0,Vini_Dalvino

UnethicalLifeProTips,"90% of the time people selling on Craigslist want to sell *fast* and need cash *now*.  But they don't want to feel ripped off.  So give them a super duper mega low ball, and then just a regular lowball.  Put the power in your hands, and *make* them feel like they are getting the better side of the deal. 



Step 1: create a Google voice account.  It's free.  It gives you a phone # connected to your Google account. You can call and text with it. 

Step 2: find what you want on Craigslist

Step 3: text the # on the Craigslist ad lowballing the shit out if them.  use this to gauge their response.  most stuff sits forever on Craigslist and buyers are often flaky, or just flat out retarded.  say theres a car up for $5k.  Offer them $2.5k with your Google voice account phone #. If they say yes then buy it, but likely they will say no.  Ask a lot of questions. Be interested, and reply quickly

Step 4: wait a couple minutes, and then text them with your real phone #.  offter them a little more, but not much.  so offer like $2.8-$3k for that car you just ""offered"" $2.5k with your Google voice phone #

Step 5: buyer will weigh his options, and choose the ""higher"" option, even though the 2 offers are coming from the same person (you) and one is super shitty, while the other is only slightly less shitty.  He's gonna take the higher offer, so offer what you want with your real #, and go 20-30% lower than that with your Google voice phone #


I've used this to get a car, a DJI drone, woodworking tools, a snowboard, and a camera.

This works for anyone you regularly are in contact or live with, so friends family and coworkers usually.

Get caught lying about little things, like eating the last [food item] or something. When you get caught, lie like a deer in a street lamp, be unconvincing and unconfident. After doing this a few times, you are seen as a bad liar. 
Another thing you can do is to laugh when it’s brought up, as in a laugh that you know something but don’t want to say it. Just act suspicious when asked basically so you get caught in the lie.

Now when you actually need to lie, just go for it, straight face, confident voice, no stammering and a convincing but not overly though our seeming story.

Until today when I surprisingly got a letter from IRS with a fat stimulus cheque inside. And I am baffled, I did not apply for it but got it anyway! What am I supposed to do? My employment was not impacted by the virus as I wasn't planning to go to the US anyway. I am not a resident, I am not an American. 1200$ is a lot of money, am I allowed to keep it? Or should I return it? I am really afraid of the US feds if keeping it turns out to be illegal, as my country is a close ally to the USA and we have a lot of laws facilliating extradition and punishment for criminals/tax frauds.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Step 1: Make sure you have both apps downloaded.

Step 2: On both apps, put in the address and get quotes during NON-SURGE hours (I use this for rush hour in Manhattan so like 2pm when I plan to leave at 5pm.)

Step 3: Leave the app open for the lower priced one at the screen just before you click to call the car.

Step 4: When you want to leave during surge pricing, bring up the app (should still have the old pricing for that trip queued up) and call the car.

Step 5: The trip will still have the price it quoted you earlier.

I’ve used this to get literally half price rides.

(It’s unethical cause the driver doesn’t realize they’re getting paid the non-surge rate until after.)

UnethicalLifeProTips,"So for about two years I barbacked/bartended at a club. It was a combination restaurant/club with the restaurant on the ground level and the club underneath. The entire place was horribly mismanaged. Your typical ""one person quits and management expects everyone else to pick up the slack without compensation or hiring a replacement"" kinda deal. Checks would bounce CONSTANTLY, power would go out in the middle of a crowded night because the owners didn't pay the electric bill, the place was really a shit-show. Literally. We had horrible leaks that brought horrible smells which the owners did NOTHING about. Their solution was to burn an ungodly amount of incense and when customers complained just tell them ""were working on it.""

I was always treated very well there, but that's in large part because I was the only American working there. Everyone else was an immigrant who was in some way or another being taken advantage of. The owners knew that most of them did not have papers, worked multiple jobs, and needed this one as well.

As you can guess, the place was eventually shut down. It closed in late December, right at the height of the ""busy season"" for restaurants and clubs. We held a lot of private events, especially around the holidays, and everyone was making really good money. But then they closed down.

No one was paid for the month of December. We were told that the owners (a married couple, we'll call them Dan and Mikayla) were in debt to multiple people and that we would receive our wages once they had paid off their debt.

I was then informed by a coworker that they were planing to go before a judge to declare bankruptcy and that any employees that were owed money should attend the hearing and state their case. It is important to note that by the time they went before a judge I was in Europe for a semester abroad and was unable to attend the court date. My coworker who went said she was the only one who showed up. As I said, many of my coworkers were undocumented immigrants who didn't feel comfortable/weren't able to attend.

Well, the judge ruled that they DID NOT have to pay back any of their employees. I even got a letter in the mail stating it was ILLEGAL for me to contact them to request my money. This is infuriating to me as I know they have the means to pay us back and just hid their assets from the judge. (To give one example, they lived in one apartment, but owned two separate apartments in the building above the restaurant that they rented them out via airbnb for extra income).

They owe me $2,000. As I said, I was the only American working there, and I am very blessed to have parents who support me, so that $2,000 did not set me back as much as my coworkers. I can let that go.

What I cannot let go is the way they treated my coworkers. Particularly one coworker, we'll call her Emily. Emily was treated like dirt since day one. They worked her 7 days a week (even tho we're closed on sudays), she had bounced paychecks dating back for months. The owners even hired her to babysit for them, and they built up a very friendly relationship. But when they got shut down, they owed her about $6,000. Whats worse, because of an issue with her citizenship she was forced to return home to Europe and is not allowed back in the US. She has not seen a penny of her back-wages and at this point she has no legal recourse to get it back.

Some nights I lay awake thinking about how much I hate the owners. Not for how they treated me, but how they treated my coworkers. These are greedy, White, business owners who blatantly took advantage of immigrants (primarily of Hispanic or Eastern European descent) who ran their business into the ground and got off completely scot-free.

My current idea is to make a craigslist ad for an amazing restaurant job opportunity ($25/hr, 5 hour shifts, $300 in tips guaranteed per shift) and listing their email and phone number. But I am open to anything the great people of r/UnethicalLifeProTips might have to offer.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I ordered an item through Amazon about a week ago. Instead of choosing an Amazon locker under ""pickup locations,"" I added the locker as a ""new address,"" filled out the fields with the locker's address, and added my name in the appropriate field.

Amazon alerted me that my package arrived to the locker within a day, but it wasn't yet ready for pickup as it takes time to process the packages. I assumed it would be ready for pickup the next day as Prime guarantees two-day shipping, but after three or four days without receiving the pickup code I called Amazon to see what happened.

It turns out that an Amazon locker has difficultly recognizing packages with names listed in the address field (shipping an item through ""pickup locations"" does not put your name on the package). This means that it can take longer than two days for them to sort those packages. Since I couldn't pick up my package within the two-day Prime guarantee, Amazon sent me the same item again for free. The item that I initially ordered was still at the locker so I received the first item after the second one, one they had finally finished processing it.

UnethicalLifeProTips," Hi! I bought my first house 3 years ago. When I bought the house, there was water damage on one wall in the basement at the bottom of the wall. The seller gave me a $10k repair credit, and I had french drains put in along the wall. We didn't bother replacing the drywall at that time because we are basically never in the basement and it was cosmetic.

Yesterday we were in our basement and noticed water damage coming down from the top of the wall, above the ground-line outside. It looks like it might be from the ceiling. We've been having issues with our garbage disposal in our kitchen not working and this spot is right below our kitchen sink and dishwasher. Based on my googling, this would not be covered by insurance because it doesn't seem to be a sudden broken pipe. You can see the bubbling and it feels slightly cool (barely) but not wet, and it's not like water is spraying everywhere. I think it's been going on for a while (maybe a week? a month?) but we just didn't know because we are never down there. Any tips on what we need to do or say to get this covered by insurance? Do we need to literally bust a pipe and let it start spraying everywhere? Describe it a certain way? Avoid saying certain things? Dropping thousands upon thousands of dollars outside insurance is basically giving me a heart attack.

Can I go pick up the ring or send a friend and not have backlash if they figure it out later?  Or should I send a friend and cease all contact, instead purchasing through another name?

Tried talking to him in-person twice, always answers positively yet turns the volume of his music up as soon as I go back downstairs.

I have documented his noise in several videos, have videos of the used condom, and have also made 3 noise complaints so far to non-emergency line (311 in New York).

I just renewed my lease and my ~~slumlord~~ landlord ignored my emails over the past month.

My lease has a ""quiet enjoyment"" clause but I like my apartment and would like to get him evicted instead.

Pros: he obviously uses drugs as I hear him dry heaving/coughing. NYC still hasn't legalized weed so this might be something to use?

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I'm in college for my second degree. Due to financial circumstances and medical circumstances before college, I qualified (and still qualify) for a long list of grants and scholarships. The first time I pursued a degree, everything was covered. Same with this time. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of scholarships and grants. The best part? I use it on whatever I want because of the significant amount that's leftover. I'm a disabled student with medical conditions, who's on disability, section 8 housing, LIHEAP, and food stamps. You may think that my leftover grant and scholarship money just rolls over to the next semester. It doesn't.

Instead, I get a refund through my school account (which can be used as a credit/debit card with my school account card to make purchases or withdrawal cash from ATMs). Then the process starts all over again during the next semester. My grants (and even some of my scholarships) are renewable. At the same time, there's always thousands of excess leftover on my account each semester. I've already bought a car, gone out to eat at many restaurants, moved into a better apartment, traveled (plane tickets) and also saved some of the money.

If you're in college, apply for every grant and scholarship you can find in which you meet requirements for. After rewarded, whatever is leftover after each semester charge will go to your account as a leftover refundable balance. You can do whatever you want with it. Enjoy! I called the social security office and asked if college, grants, or scholarships affect disability benefits or any other benefits. They said no.

TL;DR They're probably assuming all scholarship/grant money gets used up each semester (aren't aware of the debit, credit, cash refunds). But hey, they didn't ask for the details so...

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Sorry for the formatting. I’m On mobile. 

So I live in a duplex outside of city limits. But it’s a very tiny 2 bedroom. They’ve got 6 adults, a teenager, 2 toddlers, and 3 dogs living in that itty bitty place. They’ve constantly got at least 4 cars parked in a one spot carport. 

My neighbors are constantly hitting the walls and slamming doors. Now I live with my husband and 6 month old baby. And I try to recall any time I’ve touched or hit the walls and I can only think of a time or two and it was completely on accident. 

But when I say constantly, just last night at 4 am I jumped awake to them slamming things around in their house and proceeded to wake my baby. I’ve tried talking to them but it just seems like they’re careless. My landlord is an old lady who is going through dementia. I’ve asked her to help me get the neighbors to calm down a little bit. Every time she does, she suggests that I talk to them myself. Which I have. I’ve mentioned how they have entirely too many people living there but the neighbors claim that those people are just visiting. Every day. And night. Since they moved in. 

And something else minor but somehow it seems like someone is always outside smoking. So it stinks outside too. And they smell like absolute garbage and butt hole. I don’t even know how to explain it. It just smells horrendous over there. And they’re always outside talking and cackling. The toddlers also run around naked and screaming so loud I can hear them over the tv. I’m not sure how they’re banging the walls and slamming doors and being outside at the same time but there’s enough humans in that house it doesn’t surprise me anymore. 

I feel somewhat bad because the teenage kid likes to help out by raking our yard and looking out for snakes. He’s also helped when my dog escaped our yard. It just seems like everyone in that house is obliviously slamming things. It’s affecting us so much that we don’t really get any sleep anymore. My baby can’t take naps without constantly being interrupted. 

Any ideas on how to piss them off? Persuade them to move? Get back at them? Anything to give them a taste of their own medicine? 

I thought about getting a water gun of liquid ass and spraying it all over their yard and front porch. Maybe that’ll make them less inclined on staying around much. We share the same air conditioner so I can’t sabotage that. And they’ve made it clear that they have guns.

I can't take care of him either because I work full time and don't drive, plus I passed through a lot because of him.

Use the code once and it will no longer work.

**From this point forward** whenever you use the code, claim that you trued previously and your card was declined.

If the cashier is told that the card was declined, they will usually either A: give you the item, or B: apologize for you losing the item and give you a coupon.

This varies by franchise, and some (if very few) will turn you away when you do this. The cashiers are trained not to accuse, and will *always* be non-confrontational, even when they know you're full of shit.

Whatever happens, **never let the cashier touch or hold your phone**. If they try: shove it in your pocket, act disgruntled, and leave.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"1) Find a DD-214 online. This the discharge form used to tell whether a veteran is legit. Fill it out convincingly. Also look for a benefits card. They're a bit harder to find but it helps.

2) Never say or anything too incredible. People often become suspicious If you claim to be a war hero. Also stay away from professions that deal with specific technology like mechanics. 

3) Pretend to be something low-key that every base needs like a cook or an analyst. Then learn the MOS or job code for it

4) Get to know some basic Regulations and facts about the military. 

-AR 670-1: Dress and appearance for the Army

-AFI 36-2903: Dress and appearance for the Air Force

-The UCMJ: uniform code of military Justice AKA military law.

5) NEVER purchase or wear a uniform. This makes it all too easy to snuff out fakes. Any veteran will just show their DD-214

6) NEVER claim to be high-ranked. Always claim to have gotten out as an E-4. This is the most common pay grade to get out at

E-4's go by different names per branch here's a list: 
specialist in the Army, 
corporal in the Marine Corps, 
senior airman in the Air Force, 
petty officer third class in the Navy.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"When you’re running late and inevitably need to speed, you can mitigate the risk of receiving a hefty ticket by practicing intelligent speeding. The idea is counter-intuitive—speed as slow as possible—but it actually makes a lot of sense. I’ll do my best to hash it out. 

There are often situations that will slow you down while speeding (e.g., another car driving the speed limit on a single lane road) or bring you to a screeching halt (e.g. a red light). Accurately assessing these annoying circumstances is the key to “intelligent speeding.” Let’s take the example of a different car driving the speed limit (30mph) on a single lane road. If the car is about 100 meters away from you, then there is little sense in speeding at 65mph, only to be halted by there leisurely travel. Risking a ticket for 35mph over the speed limit is silly when you’re going to be slowed by grandma in her Oldsmobile. Instead, choose a slower speed that will still enable you to catch grandma (e.g., 45mph) and prepare for your next move to open up. This principle can be applied in numerous situations and mitigates the risk of receiving a ticket.",25,ULPT: Intelligent Speeding.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom):

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -> ""Contact Us"" -> ""Continue to contact form"" -> ""Other"" -> (check off whatever agencies) -> other -> Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I’m renting an expensive studio apartment in California. A new neighbor moved right next door a month ago (we share a wall). Their dog (dog’s are allowed to live in the community) has been barking for long periods of time during the evening and has regularly woken me up multiple occasions during the early mornings. I took audio and photo evidence and notified management about it a month ago. They assured me they would contact the neighbor to work on a resolution.

The situation hasn't been resolved and management has supposedly been going through the legal process which they tell me they are unable to provide any more details about but have assured me will address the issue. That's been going on for several weeks now. In the meantime, I’ve been asked to call courtesy patrol when there is barking and I’ve done this repeatedly over the past two weeks, sometimes up to 5 times during the evening. The patrol service isn't having any success (not surprised) and are hesitant to send someone out. I've been calling still to document the issue and it's the only ""power"" I feel I have.

I recently signed a new lease, unfortunately, but I’m exhausted and this situation has been taking a toll on my personal and professional life. Also, I don’t enjoy going home because it’s turned into such a toxic situation for me.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Hello,

(I apologize in advance for my Enghlish as it's not my first language).

**tldr at the end.**

About 9 days ago I've sent money to my girlfirend (half rent, wifi, etc.), but transaction somehow failed and until this day she didn't arrived money that also disappeard from my account. At the beggining I've been waiting, because transaction could be just delayed and I didn'I want to be hystorical. After 5 days of waiting, I've start to solve the problem. First I've ask on online chat what happen and the guy was very helpful and gave me telephone number to call some specialist that would trace and resolve my problem. Unfortunately, next day I've been waiting long time to connect me with specialist, which would not be able to trace my transaction for some reason and tell me to in 15 minutes). So I've called again and some girl (I don't know she's name but she was not the mentioned specialist, but was very nice to me and tolerable to my weak ensglish. But only thing I've been informate about was that transaction was lost and I should call next day to different number when they help me and resolve my problem.

And as I'm poor eastern European man trying to achieve better life for me and my girlfriend, definitely not bad person, but struggling with finances, I would like to get some advice how can I mine some money from this event. I will not hurt anybody from nice staff, I just want some advice how can I mine some money from the corporation.

My girlfriend is not dying from starvation, she was also able to make a deal with rent payment. I just want some advice how to exploit this situation for some smooth self-enrichment.

Thank you for every advice and sorry againt for consufed speech and syntax errors, I hope it's readable for you.

tldr:

I'm currently living in England, my girlfriend is living in Czech Republic. I've sent her money for half rent, wifi etc., but they didn't arrived on time. After 5 days I've started to solve the problem with live chat, making calls etc. Staff was nice, but in 9th day I've found out my transaction was somehow lost and I should call again tomorrow. My girlfriend have still some money and got a deal with houseowner to pay rent less. Could you give me some advice, my friends, how can I mine money from this corporation mistake?

If approved sit on a stool or have a little white plastic fold up table layed our with a money box and a cup of straws. Have all the straws brand new from whatever restaurants are at your college.
