,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Hello, so I got into an accident that was not my fault. The insurance company for the person at fault has issued me a check.

edit 2: I kept getting asked questions about ambulance and I knew there was something I wanted to remember. I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it's not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it's really supposed to be kept by you.  

 I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate ""tip,"" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt.

So I thought I'd share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing &amp; collections agency.

**Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a ""Healthcare in the US is broken"" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn't the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post.

If you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I'll say ""hospitals"" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes.

***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:***

**Your debt goes in stages:**

* Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They're nice when it's still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there's no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL!
* Bad Debt **Contractors** \- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work
* Bad Debt **Purchasers** \- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt.

There are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don't know if there's an official term for each type, but I'll make up my own.

* **Contract** \- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount.
* And **Purchasers** \- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies.

***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:***

* **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it's medical debt.**

\--&gt; Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it's a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn't pay your portion, or if you didn't have insurance AND didn't attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so.

* **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.**

\--&gt; Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it's expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it's the last resort after a certain time frame, but ""Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid"" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren't resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it's common.

* **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.**

\--&gt; Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit &amp; stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue.

On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don't go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don't expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.

If it's a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn't worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we'd always send it if we couldn't convince the client to pay in installments. It's worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.

You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your 'proof of debt' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won't list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.

That's not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don't want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!

* **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they've got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!**

\--&gt; Bitch, please. They know it's yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn't they? The only thing you're doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.

* **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights**  
or  
**Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn't authorize them to collect the debt, and they're violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!**

\--&gt; Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They're not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn't know why you went.

* **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.**

\--&gt; Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don't report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There's no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don't report to credit on THIS account, if we didn't. But then we'd give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don't assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.

* **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!**

\--&gt; Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can't call/write/etc you, that doesn't stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.

It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom's car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility's network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).

* **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!**

\--&gt; In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it's you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they're calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it's your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it's name/address/year of birth. The agency's lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what's on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it's for your protection.

You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state ""collections"" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep's name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don't know if they're legit. If they are legit, they'll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they'll resend a letter if you tell them you'll pay, etc.

Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it's a scam. That's the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).

* **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!**

\--&gt; *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer's contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it's not foolproof.

If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.

If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we're not going to call back...but that doesn't always stop the process.

I don't know the time frame on that because I wasn't in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.

**LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:**

* ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It's always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.
* ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you'd like. That being said, it doesn't automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you're making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.
* ***""This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.""*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you're in collections. Like, duh.  
They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don't miss a payment. But don't think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they're more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.

**MAGIC WORD:**  
**I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality **if the D-word is said, it's a dispute.**

Good, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn't receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure.

Bullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I'm racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don't want to pay, my insurance should have paid this.

But again if you say **DISPUTE** \- they can ask more questions to see if it's a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you're disputing it and they don't immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate.

**THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:**  
\-If you say dispute and they don't stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA.  
\-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA.  
\-If they say it's a **debt** before confirming it's you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go.

**What to do on every medical collections call:**  
\-Get the name of the agency and the representative you're speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on.  
\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it's a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?  
\-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over?  
\-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn't clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it's in Bad Debt.  
\-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they'll only use those kindnesses if you're not a douche.

&lt;p&gt;On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don&amp;#39;t go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don&amp;#39;t expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn&amp;#39;t worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we&amp;#39;d always send it if we couldn&amp;#39;t convince the client to pay in installments. It&amp;#39;s worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your &amp;#39;proof of debt&amp;#39; because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won&amp;#39;t list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don&amp;#39;t want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they&amp;#39;ve got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Bitch, please. They know it&amp;#39;s yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn&amp;#39;t they? The only thing you&amp;#39;re doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
or&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn&amp;#39;t authorize them to collect the debt, and they&amp;#39;re violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They&amp;#39;re not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn&amp;#39;t know why you went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don&amp;#39;t report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There&amp;#39;s no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don&amp;#39;t report to credit on THIS account, if we didn&amp;#39;t. But then we&amp;#39;d give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don&amp;#39;t assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can&amp;#39;t call/write/etc you, that doesn&amp;#39;t stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you&amp;#39;re cutting off your nose to spite your face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom&amp;#39;s car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility&amp;#39;s network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it&amp;#39;s you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they&amp;#39;re calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it&amp;#39;s your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it&amp;#39;s name/address/year of birth. The agency&amp;#39;s lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what&amp;#39;s on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it&amp;#39;s for your protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state &amp;quot;collections&amp;quot; on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep&amp;#39;s name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;re legit. If they are legit, they&amp;#39;ll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they&amp;#39;ll resend a letter if you tell them you&amp;#39;ll pay, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it&amp;#39;s a scam. That&amp;#39;s the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Maaaaybe&lt;/em&gt;. We asked for the lawyer&amp;#39;s contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it&amp;#39;s not foolproof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we&amp;#39;re not going to call back...but that doesn&amp;#39;t always stop the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know the time frame on that because I wasn&amp;#39;t in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have to go through us to pay this debt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It&amp;#39;s always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you&amp;#39;d like. That being said, it doesn&amp;#39;t automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you&amp;#39;re making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you&amp;#39;re in collections. Like, duh.&lt;br/&gt;
They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don&amp;#39;t miss a payment. But don&amp;#39;t think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they&amp;#39;re more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAGIC WORD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I DISPUTE the validity of this debt&lt;/strong&gt;. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality &lt;strong&gt;if the D-word is said, it&amp;#39;s a dispute.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn&amp;#39;t receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I&amp;#39;m racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don&amp;#39;t want to pay, my insurance should have paid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again if you say &lt;strong&gt;DISPUTE&lt;/strong&gt; - they can ask more questions to see if it&amp;#39;s a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you&amp;#39;re disputing it and they don&amp;#39;t immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-If you say dispute and they don&amp;#39;t stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA.&lt;br/&gt;
-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA.&lt;br/&gt;
-If they say it&amp;#39;s a &lt;strong&gt;debt&lt;/strong&gt; before confirming it&amp;#39;s you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do on every medical collections call:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
-Get the name of the agency and the representative you&amp;#39;re speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on.&lt;br/&gt;
-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it&amp;#39;s a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?&lt;br/&gt;
-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over?&lt;br/&gt;
-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn&amp;#39;t clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it&amp;#39;s in Bad Debt.&lt;br/&gt;
-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they&amp;#39;ll only use those kindnesses if you&amp;#39;re not a douche.&lt;br/&gt;
Also, they&amp;#39;re humans too, probably making $2 above minimum wage, and the job is really tough because people are mean and have heartbreaking stories. Be human. It helps.&lt;/p&gt;

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"My dad sucks. He beat my mother growing up, left me with a pedophile (it ended the way you’d expect) and constantly villafied my mother growing up. I was raised by my mother and have lived with him a year out of my life. That year was split up between him losing custody because he started drinking again (he is and was a huge alcoholic), then me moving in with him in adulthood only for him to kick me out (in 95 degree weather without any warning whatsoever) in an attempt to manipulate me into letting him sell my parrot. I tried time and time again to have a legitimate relationship with the man but I’ve never been successful. 

Now, I don’t hate people because they’re alcoholics. It’s a tough addiction And I applaud anyone who tries to get over it. My father, however, is a mean drunk. Very mean. He punches holes in the walls, disowns me and reowns me, tells blatant lies about my past and tries to guilt me into feeling sorry for him. 

After not speaking to him for a year, I’ve just heard that he may be in liver failure. He has two houses, one on mortgage and another he owns outright. I would like to inherit them because owning a house would be a huge step up in my life at my age (22). 

My father supposedly has narcissistic personality disorder, though I’m not sure if that’s diagnosed or not. If it isn’t, he definitely shows symptoms. Here’s my request: 

How can I contact him again and rekindle a relationship without him being suspicious? I’m not the manipulative type most of the time and already feel guilty considering doing this. My concern is that I’m sure my dad would put something in a Will saying I don’t get anything. I’d like to be on his good side. At this point he’s ruined my life once and tried to twice, and beyond the requisite “he’s my father” I don’t care all that much about him. I don’t want him to die, but if he is going to, I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to get a house.


Edit: so I’ve been talking to the girlfriend. He’s gone batshit, more so than I thought. He’s drinking even more than before, trying to start fights with the other roommate, and then calling the police on him when he doesn’t do anything. He’s told the girlfriend she’s not getting anything because she spoke to my mother (not even told my mother, just spoke to her). 

I’ve sent a message about him being sick, but deleted it before he received it (checkmark wasn’t filled in). It said “delete for you” though so I’m worried he’s seen it. If he does and flips out even more at the girlfriend I’m not sure what I should do.

Edit #2: I’ve decided not to contact him.

I have Aspergers. For those of you who think I’m evil I know that sounds like a dumbass excuse but I have a reason for telling you this. As much as you may think I’m a liar, I have never intentionally manipulated anyone in my adult life. I’ve always tried to be kind to the people I like and nice to those who hurt me. I came on hoping people who knew better could tell me how to get my dad to forgive me for whatever he thinks I’ve done and begin to value me again. Many of you delivered on just that or offered other advice on the matter. I thank you all, but I don’t believe I am mentally capable of pulling this off. 

 My social ineptitude was showing because I didn’t know that this post would upset so many people. I know now that it’s upsetting to many of you, though I’m not sure I understand why. I’ve seen so many people lie to each other about how they felt about others then hurt them, I never intended to hurt my father in the scheme I had. If my plan necessitated a “Ha-ha! Gotcha!” Moment or a piece of revenge, I’d never have considered it. To me, it meant he died happy and I got something out of it too. Definitely not selfless, definitely the most sleazy thing I’ve ever considered doing, but not something I thought would get me sent hate mail. 

I will admit that I still don’t feel as guilty for having wanted to do this as many of you expect me to. I don’t understand why it makes me a terrible person. I thought feigning interests and making people like you was commonplace, even if I’ve never tried it. I feel guilty for considering lying, but I feel guilty for telling coworkers I have plans when they ask me to cover their shift. I understand death and him being my father adds another factor, but I don’t get how it turns it from unethical to “fuck you”. I wasn’t trying to screw him over and didn’t see that as a possibility.

Maybe it’s because I never got to have the cliche father/daughter relationship. I think all of you are reading this as a person trying to do this to their dad, not the sort of relationship I have with him. I found that most people who said they have a parent with NPD were rooting for me. 

I have confirmation that he is not senile. My father is 50 with no known history of dementia in the family. I spoke to him a year ago last time he disowned me and he was fine mentally, save for having suddenly decided that he hated me. 
“He’s gone batshit” just means his drunken antics have increased. He isn’t doing anything to make me think he’s gone insane so much as he’s pissed at the world and lashing out at everyone around him. I spoke to his girlfriend and she confirmed he’s coherent, just drunk and acting the way he does when he’s drunk and has no one else to attack. If I thought for a second he was senile I’d have taken much more issue with lying to him. 

That said, many of you were asking why I wanted the houses if there was so much baggage with my dad. I will be honest and say that I struggle with adult life despite doing well at school. I’m 22 and I don’t have many of the skills I should at my age. I don’t have a credit score and every attempt to get one has been thwarted. I don’t see myself ever being successful enough at life to get a house of my own unless I got lucky. I saw this as my only chance to own a home, even if I sold the mortgaged one and bought a smaller home elsewhere. It would be difficult to figure out but I have a relative who does real estate who could’ve helped me. Maybe I’d have had to live with it the rest of my life, but I might be living a much better life if I had. 


TLDR; I was asking how to get my father (who disowned me because of his NPD) to like me again so I had a chance of getting an inheritance. I have decided not to contact him due in part to my belief that I don’t have the social skills to do such a thing and because I didn’t understand the social implications of posting this.


FINAL UPDATE: thank you to everyone who was understanding. 

It’s come out that my father was lying. He told everyone he had 10% liver function remaining.

&lt;p&gt;I will admit that I still don’t feel as guilty for having wanted to do this as many of you expect me to. I don’t understand why it makes me a terrible person. I thought feigning interests and making people like you was commonplace, even if I’ve never tried it. I feel guilty for considering lying, but I feel guilty for telling coworkers I have plans when they ask me to cover their shift. I understand death and him being my father adds another factor, but I don’t get how it turns it from unethical to “fuck you”. I wasn’t trying to screw him over and didn’t see that as a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s because I never got to have the cliche father/daughter relationship. I think all of you are reading this as a person trying to do this to their dad, not the sort of relationship I have with him. I found that most people who said they have a parent with NPD were rooting for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have confirmation that he is not senile. My father is 50 with no known history of dementia in the family. I spoke to him a year ago last time he disowned me and he was fine mentally, save for having suddenly decided that he hated me. 
“He’s gone batshit” just means his drunken antics have increased. He isn’t doing anything to make me think he’s gone insane so much as he’s pissed at the world and lashing out at everyone around him. I spoke to his girlfriend and she confirmed he’s coherent, just drunk and acting the way he does when he’s drunk and has no one else to attack. If I thought for a second he was senile I’d have taken much more issue with lying to him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, many of you were asking why I wanted the houses if there was so much baggage with my dad. I will be honest and say that I struggle with adult life despite doing well at school. I’m 22 and I don’t have many of the skills I should at my age. I don’t have a credit score and every attempt to get one has been thwarted. I don’t see myself ever being successful enough at life to get a house of my own unless I got lucky. I saw this as my only chance to own a home, even if I sold the mortgaged one and bought a smaller home elsewhere. It would be difficult to figure out but I have a relative who does real estate who could’ve helped me. Maybe I’d have had to live with it the rest of my life, but I might be living a much better life if I had. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I was asking how to get my father (who disowned me because of his NPD) to like me again so I had a chance of getting an inheritance. I have decided not to contact him due in part to my belief that I don’t have the social skills to do such a thing and because I didn’t understand the social implications of posting this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINAL UPDATE: thank you to everyone who was understanding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s come out that my father was lying. He told everyone he had 10% liver function remaining. He’s admitted to his girlfriend that he’s down 10% with 90% remaining, not down 90 with 10% remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"You sleep days, so.... you rent a large storage room at one of those self-storage places.  

Many of those places allow you to use them as Mancaves or makeshift workshops to hang out in all day. You just gotta keep the door open while you do it. 

 So you bring in stuff that hides your sleeping area. You can make walls out of shelving units filled with boxes to keep any management/nosey employees from easily finding you. Make it a maze/and or block their way with boxes so they cannot easily get to you. Buy a motion-detecting driveway alert or doorway alert that has an alert tone that is the sound of  a phone ringing (I own one that does this) to wake you up when someone enters your unit. 

Then you can jump up and act like you are reorganizing or any activity that isnt sleeping.  

You could also make a completely hidden sleeping area that no one can find .... like a large box you get inside to sleep. You can lock it from the inside. 

-----------------------

Another idea (while I'm at it).... make a deal with another person that roughly looks like you that works days so you can alternate your sleeping in the unit. You go to sleep during the day... your partner leaves and locks you in until he comes back from his job after his shift, and you switch places. You lock him in while you go to work. Note: be sure to have a power tool in the unit that can easily cut you out in case of an emergency. Both wear the same outfit when coming and going so it appears as if the same person comes in for a 20 minutes or so and then leaves.

,UnethicalLifeProTips," Hi! I bought my first house 3 years ago. When I bought the house, there was water damage on one wall in the basement at the bottom of the wall. The seller gave me a $10k repair credit, and I had french drains put in along the wall. We didn't bother replacing the drywall at that time because we are basically never in the basement and it was cosmetic.

Yesterday we were in our basement and noticed water damage coming down from the top of the wall, above the ground-line outside. It looks like it might be from the ceiling. We've been having issues with our garbage disposal in our kitchen not working and this spot is right below our kitchen sink and dishwasher. Based on my googling, this would not be covered by insurance because it doesn't seem to be a sudden broken pipe. You can see the bubbling and it feels slightly cool (barely) but not wet, and it's not like water is spraying everywhere. I think it's been going on for a while (maybe a week? a month?) but we just didn't know because we are never down there. Any tips on what we need to do or say to get this covered by insurance?

,UnethicalLifeProTips," This works in everything from childrearing to politics; If you don't want someone to do something, agree that they have a *permission* to do so, but only if it's done properly.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Let me clarify - canI use my spouses NON-CURRENT student loan to pay off my CURRENT student loan?

Maybe this is a rare circumstance and forgive me for my ignorance. 

My spouse is going to graduate school. I finished my masters and am making payments on my student loans (17K). My thought is since my current loan is accruing interest now and my spouse’s is not why not take out more in their student loans, pay mine off, and continue to make payments towards their student loan. 

TLDR:
My student loan: 17K accruing interest

Spouses (current grad student): 5K no interest until 6 months after graduation - can get 2X the amount needed for school in student loans. 

Solution? - consolidate both loans using Spouse’s student loan and thus utilizing no interest aspect. 

Anyone know if this would work? In theory this seems like a no brainer but feel like it is too good to be true. Thanks for any responses!

EDIT: Well fuck me. After doing more due diligence (and many smarter people’s comments), turns out that the spouses loan accrues interest immediately not like I was thinking.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489589-senate-rejects-gop-attempt-to-change-unemployment-benefits-in-stimulus-bill

The new stimulus bill provides $600/week in unemployment benefits, in addition to existing benefits which vary by state, but usually amount to roughly half of your previous wages.

For example, in Illinois, if you make $52,000 a year, that's $1k a week. Get laid off, you get $600 + $471 a week in unemployment benefits= $1071 a week.

Now, you have to be clever. If you get fired for misconduct, you're not eligible for unemployment. So you can't just start screaming profanities to get fired.

Instead, start talking to coworkers about your salary and ask theirs. Start encouraging coworkers to form a union, in earshot of your boss.

It is illegal to fire a worker for those reasons, but it will make them try to find a way to lay you off, such as bad job performance(which doesn't kill eligibility for unemployment). If they try to dispute your claim, just threaten to sue them for violating right to unionize. They'll back off.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Honestly this could even be a LPT, but since it involves dishonesty I guess it goes here.

I interned at a company that bonded felons so they could get jobs (it's like insurance, if the felon steals the bonding company covers it).

Many high end jobs, even 6 figure salaried positions; don't background check. Almost all jobs however do ask if you're a felon.

**By checking the felon box, you're likely not even going to get an interview**. It's just the truth. Felons are the only class not protected federally by work equality laws. If you owned a business, would you take the felon or the equally qualified non felon?

**However, by NOT checking that box - You can get the interview, you can get the job**, and if it happens to come up later; you have a better chance of staying on board if they like you/are happy with your performance. Worst case, you get fired; which is no worse than not getting the job in the first place.

Government jobs, jobs involving children, nursing/medicine -- all background check.

Most business/corporate jobs however, don't (they may SAY they do, and they may ASK, but they usually don't actually check). Office/Admin/Sales positions rarely check. **I have a friend who made 370K last year as a Pharma Rep/Saleswoman for a huge Pharma Co. and she is a convict.**

Lastly, the jobs that usually DO hire felons, are doing it for a huge tax break; and will likely pay minimum wage (fast food, custodial, etc). Good luck supporting yourself with that salary. Also, a GOOD job willing to hire you knowing you're a felon, will slash your salary because they know you don't have a lot of options.

I was reading a post earlier on how owners of AirBnB are actually allowed to install cameras in common areas as long as they state this int he description. In the comments, someone was talking about how they have found hidden cameras in their rooms while travelling for business and staying in very nice, expensive and busy Hotels.

Based on this and other comments, it occurs very frequently.

A hidden cam will cost you about $50 online. One of these, a screw driver and an air vent, thermostat, lamp or whatever and you're golden; you could even just tape it under a desk.

If you called the hotel staff in and threw a fit, they will probably do just about anything to prevent you from leaving a bad review or getting the press or police involved.

Free room, upgraded room, meal &amp; drink vouchers, you name it.

Should probably file down the serial number and buy a SD card with cash somewhere local to really sell the thing, just in case. But in all likelihood, they want to sweep the whole thing under the rug. It's probably \*actually\* happened before. The hotel staff may even be doing it in other rooms.

Your goal is not to actually get police involved, just to threaten that, or other legal action. 

Probably wouldn't work in an AirBnB setting, so stick with big name hotels.

Edit: To everyone saying that they will catch you with their own hidden cameras: so what?

That's the whole point. You're relying on the fact that they probably are aware of hidden cameras in the hotel. They're not going to give themselves up to out you. They'll be very happy to give you free stuff so you go away.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"To make a long story short, I'm a casual (not full time or part time - day to day) employee who has a verbal agreement to work a full time schedule. Though I have a verbal agreement to work everyday, I have been told I can take days off if I need to.

One of my shifts this week will be absolutely shit (in terms of the behaviour of those I have to manage, I know what it is in advance), but another workplace has offered me a shift on that day with possibly better conditions for more money.

I need a believable excuse that will allow me to take that day off but also allow for a credible cover story if I am questioned about going to work at the other place. The reason that I could be questioned is that the two workplaces are not too far away from each other and there are families that send their children to both of these workplaces -- I don't want to be in a situation where I get ""oh, we saw u/lana_del_reymysterio today"" and that gets back to the wrong people somehow.

My current idea was say I can't come in on that day due to needing to go to x appointment. My cover story idea if questioned is appointment got cancelled day of, figured too late to say I can work now, got a call from other workplace saying to come in so I accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: It's not a question of if I can take a day off as I can and don't need to give a reason. However, I will need a backup plan (cover story) in case they do find out I was working somewhere else instead.

Can I go pick up the ring or send a friend and not have backlash if they figure it out later?  Or should I send a friend and cease all contact, instead purchasing through another name?

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"90% of the time people selling on Craigslist want to sell *fast* and need cash *now*.  But they don't want to feel ripped off.  So give them a super duper mega low ball, and then just a regular lowball.  Put the power in your hands, and *make* them feel like they are getting the better side of the deal. 



Step 1: create a Google voice account.  It's free.  It gives you a phone # connected to your Google account. You can call and text with it. 

Step 2: find what you want on Craigslist

Step 3: text the # on the Craigslist ad lowballing the shit out if them.  use this to gauge their response.  most stuff sits forever on Craigslist and buyers are often flaky, or just flat out retarded.  say theres a car up for $5k.  Offer them $2.5k with your Google voice account phone #. If they say yes then buy it, but likely they will say no.  Ask a lot of questions. Be interested, and reply quickly

Step 4: wait a couple minutes, and then text them with your real phone #.  offter them a little more, but not much.  so offer like $2.8-$3k for that car you just ""offered"" $2.5k with your Google voice phone #

Step 5: buyer will weigh his options, and choose the ""higher"" option, even though the 2 offers are coming from the same person (you) and one is super shitty, while the other is only slightly less shitty.  He's gonna take the higher offer, so offer what you want with your real #, and go 20-30% lower than that with your Google voice phone #


I've used this to get a car, a DJI drone, woodworking tools, a snowboard, and a camera.

Step 2: On both apps, put in the address and get quotes during NON-SURGE hours (I use this for rush hour in Manhattan so like 2pm when I plan to leave at 5pm.)

Step 3: Leave the app open for the lower priced one at the screen just before you click to call the car.

Step 4: When you want to leave during surge pricing, bring up the app (should still have the old pricing for that trip queued up) and call the car.

Step 5: The trip will still have the price it quoted you earlier.

I’ve used this to get literally half price rides.

(It’s unethical cause the driver doesn’t realize they’re getting paid the non-surge rate until after.)

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Hey everyone. My friend is a police dispatcher and he wanted to share some tips with us because his boss is a dick. Pretty much every police department uses radios to communicate, and not many agencies use encrypted systems.

**""How do I get set up?""**

If you live in a somewhat large city, chances are there might be a live feed of your area's radio traffic already being streamed. In that case, all you need is an app on your phone.

If a live stream isn't available, you can get a radio scanner for about $150 (for an analog system) to $300 (for newer digital systems). Not sure which one you need? Go to [Radio Reference](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/) and put your zip code in the search box. It will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area. Click on the name of the agency, and look under ""Mode"". If it has ""A"" it's analog, ""D"" is digital, and ""M"" is mixed (use a digital scanner). If you see the letter ""E"", that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner won't work (see below for a workaround). A digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well. There are programming guides online, but many new scanners are plug and play: you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself. 

**""So what can I do with a scanner?""**

Lots of things, ranging from harmless to borderline-illegal:

* Listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them.

* Set your radio in ""close call"" mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby. That means there's generally a cop, paramedic, or firefighter nearby.

* Get the scoop on what's going on in the neighborhood.

* Use it when committing a crime. You can hear the police get dispatched, so you know when it's time to leave. You can also hear if they're going to a call on the other side of town, so use that to your advantage.

**""I hear them talking, but I can't understand them. What do I do?""**

If it's just them talking too fast, you'll get used to it. Trust me. It's easy to develop a ""radio ear"" in as little as a few hours of listening.

Many departments use ""10-codes"" which are used to shorten messages and provide some (very weak) security. Many of you already know a few, such as 10-4 for ""understood"". 10-4 is the only universal 10-code, but there are some semi-standardized lists you can find [here](http://copradar.com/tencodes/index.html). If those codes aren't the same ones used near you, look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department, they tend to be similar to local 10-codes.

You don't even *need* to know what the 10-codes are for certain crimes. When a call is dispatched, the address is almost always given in an uncoded format. For example, we might say:

&gt; All units, 10-35 in progress at 123 Main Street. Responding units acknowledge.

So if you're breaking into the house at 123 Main Street, you don't need to know that a 10-35 is a burglary, you just know that the cops are on their way and it's time to get out of there. Also listen for alert tones (such as a long, steady beep or a ""wee-woo"" warble tone) that often indicate a serious crime in progress.

If you hear static or can't understand much at all, you might need a good antenna. Amazon sells a decent car roof antenna for about $15 and it's well worth it. Range depends on the antenna you get and the system they're using, but for me is generally about 20 miles from the nearest repeater.

**My local department encrypts their radio channels. What can I do?""**

An encrypted system isn't the end of the world. If you plan on using a radio for... less than legal reasons, then it's easy to steal one. Call the cops for a routine theft report or something, and have someone else steal the handheld radio from the car. Dispatch can remotely deactivate a radio, but we very rarely do unless you transmit on it and disrupt our operations. The NYPD has been having issues with stolen radios and they don't even encrypt most of their channels.

**Anything I should be careful about?**

Yes:

* A few states (such as Florida and New York) prohibit the use of a scanner in a vehicle, unless you're a licensed amateur radio operator (which is an easy license to get).

* Using a scanner during a crime can get you extra charges, depending on where you live.

* Dispatch has no way of knowing if you're using a scanner, but officers will often let us know if there are scanners located at an address so we can update our records.

* There are other ways for officers and dispatch to communicate. They will often relay sensitive information (such as a criminal history) via phone or an instant messenger system.

**TL;DR** Get a police radio scanner. They have many uses if you want to hear what the cops are doing.",t2_obfhcr4,False,,0,False,"ULPT: Carry a police radio scanner in your car, it can come handy",[],r/UnethicalLifeProTips,False,7,,0,,False,t3_e38vai,False,light,0.94,,public,319,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Productivity,False,319,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1575026351.0,text,7,,,text,self.UnethicalLifeProTips,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone. My friend is a police dispatcher and he wanted to share some tips with us because his boss is a dick. Pretty much every police department uses radios to communicate, and not many agencies use encrypted systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;How do I get set up?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you live in a somewhat large city, chances are there might be a live feed of your area&amp;#39;s radio traffic already being streamed. In that case, all you need is an app on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a live stream isn&amp;#39;t available, you can get a radio scanner for about $150 (for an analog system) to $300 (for newer digital systems). Not sure which one you need? Go to &lt;a href=""http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/""&gt;Radio Reference&lt;/a&gt; and put your zip code in the search box. It will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area. Click on the name of the agency, and look under &amp;quot;Mode&amp;quot;. If it has &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s analog, &amp;quot;D&amp;quot; is digital, and &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; is mixed (use a digital scanner). If you see the letter &amp;quot;E&amp;quot;, that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner won&amp;#39;t work (see below for a workaround). A digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well. There are programming guides online, but many new scanners are plug and play: you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;So what can I do with a scanner?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of things, ranging from harmless to borderline-illegal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set your radio in &amp;quot;close call&amp;quot; mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby. That means there&amp;#39;s generally a cop, paramedic, or firefighter nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the scoop on what&amp;#39;s going on in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use it when committing a crime. You can hear the police get dispatched, so you know when it&amp;#39;s time to leave. You can also hear if they&amp;#39;re going to a call on the other side of town, so use that to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;I hear them talking, but I can&amp;#39;t understand them. What do I do?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s just them talking too fast, you&amp;#39;ll get used to it. Trust me. It&amp;#39;s easy to develop a &amp;quot;radio ear&amp;quot; in as little as a few hours of listening.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of you already know a few, such as 10-4 for &amp;quot;understood&amp;quot;. 10-4 is the only universal 10-code, but there are some semi-standardized lists you can find &lt;a href=""http://copradar.com/tencodes/index.html""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If those codes aren&amp;#39;t the same ones used near you, look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department, they tend to be similar to local 10-codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t even &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to know what the 10-codes are for certain crimes. When a call is dispatched, the address is almost always given in an uncoded format. For example, we might say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All units, 10-35 in progress at 123 Main Street. Responding units acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom):

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -&gt; ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"" -&gt; ""Other"" -&gt; (check off whatever agencies) -&gt; other -&gt; Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"So for about two years I barbacked/bartended at a club. It was a combination restaurant/club with the restaurant on the ground level and the club underneath. The entire place was horribly mismanaged. Your typical ""one person quits and management expects everyone else to pick up the slack without compensation or hiring a replacement"" kinda deal. Checks would bounce CONSTANTLY, power would go out in the middle of a crowded night because the owners didn't pay the electric bill, the place was really a shit-show. Literally. We had horrible leaks that brought horrible smells which the owners did NOTHING about. Their solution was to burn an ungodly amount of incense and when customers complained just tell them ""were working on it.""

I was always treated very well there, but that's in large part because I was the only American working there. Everyone else was an immigrant who was in some way or another being taken advantage of. The owners knew that most of them did not have papers, worked multiple jobs, and needed this one as well.

As you can guess, the place was eventually shut down. It closed in late December, right at the height of the ""busy season"" for restaurants and clubs. We held a lot of private events, especially around the holidays, and everyone was making really good money. But then they closed down.

No one was paid for the month of December. We were told that the owners (a married couple, we'll call them Dan and Mikayla) were in debt to multiple people and that we would receive our wages once they had paid off their debt.

I was then informed by a coworker that they were planing to go before a judge to declare bankruptcy and that any employees that were owed money should attend the hearing and state their case. It is important to note that by the time they went before a judge I was in Europe for a semester abroad and was unable to attend the court date. My coworker who went said she was the only one who showed up. As I said, many of my coworkers were undocumented immigrants who didn't feel comfortable/weren't able to attend.

Well, the judge ruled that they DID NOT have to pay back any of their employees. I even got a letter in the mail stating it was ILLEGAL for me to contact them to request my money. This is infuriating to me as I know they have the means to pay us back and just hid their assets from the judge. (To give one example, they lived in one apartment, but owned two separate apartments in the building above the restaurant that they rented them out via airbnb for extra income).

They owe me $2,000. As I said, I was the only American working there, and I am very blessed to have parents who support me, so that $2,000 did not set me back as much as my coworkers. I can let that go.

What I cannot let go is the way they treated my coworkers. Particularly one coworker, we'll call her Emily. Emily was treated like dirt since day one. They worked her 7 days a week (even tho we're closed on sudays), she had bounced paychecks dating back for months. The owners even hired her to babysit for them, and they built up a very friendly relationship. But when they got shut down, they owed her about $6,000. Whats worse, because of an issue with her citizenship she was forced to return home to Europe and is not allowed back in the US. She has not seen a penny of her back-wages and at this point she has no legal recourse to get it back.

Some nights I lay awake thinking about how much I hate the owners. Not for how they treated me, but how they treated my coworkers. These are greedy, White, business owners who blatantly took advantage of immigrants (primarily of Hispanic or Eastern European descent) who ran their business into the ground and got off completely scot-free.

My current idea is to make a craigslist ad for an amazing restaurant job opportunity ($25/hr, 5 hour shifts, $300 in tips guaranteed per shift) and listing their email and phone number. But I am open to anything the great people of r/UnethicalLifeProTips might have to offer.

3) Pretend to be something low-key that every base needs like a cook or an analyst. Then learn the MOS or job code for it

4) Get to know some basic Regulations and facts about the military.

-AFI 36-2903: Dress and appearance for the Air Force

-The UCMJ: uniform code of military Justice AKA military law.

This works for anyone you regularly are in contact or live with, so friends family and coworkers usually.

Get caught lying about little things, like eating the last [food item] or something. When you get caught, lie like a deer in a street lamp, be unconvincing and unconfident. After doing this a few times, you are seen as a bad liar. 
Another thing you can do is to laugh when it’s brought up, as in a laugh that you know something but don’t want to say it. Just act suspicious when asked basically so you get caught in the lie.

Now when you actually need to lie, just go for it, straight face, confident voice, no stammering and a convincing but not overly though our seeming story.

Amazon alerted me that my package arrived to the locker within a day, but it wasn't yet ready for pickup as it takes time to process the packages.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Upstairs neighbor uses his studio apartment as a music studio. Blaring bass music at all times of the day. Throws garbage onto my fire escape ""balcony"" (so far it's been cigarette butts, toilet paper, and a used condom). 

I live in NYC in an old apartment with thin walls.

Tried talking to him in-person twice, always answers positively yet turns the volume of his music up as soon as I go back downstairs.

I have documented his noise in several videos, have videos of the used condom, and have also made 3 noise complaints so far to non-emergency line (311 in New York).

I just renewed my lease and my ~~slumlord~~ landlord ignored my emails over the past month.

(I apologize in advance for my Enghlish as it's not my first language).

**tldr at the end.**

About 9 days ago I've sent money to my girlfirend (half rent, wifi, etc.), but transaction somehow failed and until this day she didn't arrived money that also disappeard from my account. At the beggining I've been waiting, because transaction could be just delayed and I didn'I want to be hystorical. After 5 days of waiting, I've start to solve the problem. First I've ask on online chat what happen and the guy was very helpful and gave me telephone number to call some specialist that would trace and resolve my problem. Unfortunately, next day I've been waiting long time to connect me with specialist, which would not be able to trace my transaction for some reason and tell me to in 15 minutes). So I've called again and some girl (I don't know she's name but she was not the mentioned specialist, but was very nice to me and tolerable to my weak ensglish. But only thing I've been informate about was that transaction was lost and I should call next day to different number when they help me and resolve my problem.

And as I'm poor eastern European man trying to achieve better life for me and my girlfriend, definitely not bad person, but struggling with finances, I would like to get some advice how can I mine some money from this event. I will not hurt anybody from nice staff, I just want some advice how can I mine some money from the corporation.

My girlfriend is not dying from starvation, she was also able to make a deal with rent payment. I just want some advice how to exploit this situation for some smooth self-enrichment.

Thank you for every advice and sorry againt for consufed speech and syntax errors, I hope it's readable for you.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"Sorry for the formatting. I’m On mobile. 

So I live in a duplex outside of city limits. But it’s a very tiny 2 bedroom. They’ve got 6 adults, a teenager, 2 toddlers, and 3 dogs living in that itty bitty place. They’ve constantly got at least 4 cars parked in a one spot carport. 

My neighbors are constantly hitting the walls and slamming doors. Now I live with my husband and 6 month old baby. And I try to recall any time I’ve touched or hit the walls and I can only think of a time or two and it was completely on accident. 

But when I say constantly, just last night at 4 am I jumped awake to them slamming things around in their house and proceeded to wake my baby. I’ve tried talking to them but it just seems like they’re careless. My landlord is an old lady who is going through dementia. I’ve asked her to help me get the neighbors to calm down a little bit. Every time she does, she suggests that I talk to them myself. Which I have. I’ve mentioned how they have entirely too many people living there but the neighbors claim that those people are just visiting. Every day. And night. Since they moved in. 

And something else minor but somehow it seems like someone is always outside smoking. So it stinks outside too. And they smell like absolute garbage and butt hole. I don’t even know how to explain it. It just smells horrendous over there. And they’re always outside talking and cackling. The toddlers also run around naked and screaming so loud I can hear them over the tv. I’m not sure how they’re banging the walls and slamming doors and being outside at the same time but there’s enough humans in that house it doesn’t surprise me anymore. 

I feel somewhat bad because the teenage kid likes to help out by raking our yard and looking out for snakes. He’s also helped when my dog escaped our yard. It just seems like everyone in that house is obliviously slamming things. It’s affecting us so much that we don’t really get any sleep anymore. My baby can’t take naps without constantly being interrupted. 

Any ideas on how to piss them off? Persuade them to move? Get back at them? Anything to give them a taste of their own medicine? 

I thought about getting a water gun of liquid ass and spraying it all over their yard and front porch. Maybe that’ll make them less inclined on staying around much.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"I used to do this in college when I was poor and starving. Go to any major chain restaurant website and head to the ‘Contact Us’ section of the site. Carefully email them about your horrible experience with your family, significant other or friend. Tell them how disappointed you are because it was a special occasion and the horrible experience has lead you to never want to eat there again. Make sure to tell them you’ve never had these kinds of issues before and are very disappointed things turned out this way. 

Leave a good email and phone number with them because in my experience someone may call you to follow up. As long as you can stick to your story and detail what outraged you they will offer a GC as compensation to come back and try again with them to make it up. A week or 2 later the GC will arrive in the mail and the restaurant and staff are non the wiser when you use it. 

Here are some tips I’ve learned when doing this:

1) Never give your server an actual name. Don’t get anyone in real trouble. I always say they weren’t wearing a name tag and because it was busy you can’t remember their name. The name tag thing usually irks them more. Just give a basic one off description. 

2) Never say you paid with a credit card. They will search the the transaction logs to see if your name matches any CC receipts. Always say you paid in cash. They can’t track it. 

3) You want to tell them the food was cold, undercooked, or late. Refills were almost non existent. I always say the server was hard to track down. 

4) Keep your party size small. I always say 2-4 people. Make it bigger at your own risk. 

5) Always tell them it was a Friday or Saturday. Busy days are usually met with tons of people and it’s harder to keep track. 

6) Know your menu. Make sure you know what everyone in your party ate. Make it very common and popular menu items. If you get too crazy expensive then the I used cash option looks odd. 

7) Be prepared to speak to someone. They do call to apologize and hear more about your story. Not all of them (chili’s doesn’t fucking care) but some do. They give a more personal touch. 

8) Do your restaurant research. Some chain restaurants fall under the same parent company so they all have the same complaint department. For example, Olive Garden is owned by Darden Co. They also own Long Horn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s Kitchen, Capital Grill etc. you don’t want to do this to more than one of the same restaurants under the bigger parent company. You will get caught quick. Just google: who owns X restaurant and see everything. 

9) Wait some time before doing this repeatedly to the same restaurant. I usually wait a year, but you can proceed at your own risk. 

10) Enjoy your free corporate meal or sell them for straight cash. Win win. 



***Someone asked how much they usually send you and I can tell you this much***

Olive Garden - $50

Chili’s - Varies. Once I received five $5 vouchers and once a $25 GC

Red Lobster - $50

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"This works like a charm, if your parents are middle class/or higher then you can order some lowered priced items every month by hiding the order using ""Archive this order"". This depends a lot on how much money your parents make though. And if they call Amazon they will usually not answer the question of ""why do i have a $36 charge on my amazon account when no item has been ordered this week"". But after awhile they will answer that question (my parents called like 10-14 times about this) *I don't know why they don't answer the question, maybe they think the answer is stupid. I spent like 2,000 dollars in a year, kinda messed up of course but i was broke &amp; needed money. &amp; my parents never gave money to me directly so i had to figure it out myself. Kinda of a cool little trick. \*also i was in my senior year of high school then, so i was stupid. This was 1 year ago btw.

,UnethicalLifeProTips,"I found this out because it actually was true in my case I had a 14 month employment gap after college so I could care for my grandfather who was dying from brain cancer. that gap has always hurt me when I explained it at an interview recently the interviewers entire opinion of me changed in her eyes that gap initially meant I was lazy and coasted for a year after college and once I told her I was caring for my grandfather she realized that her perception of the situation was wrong. After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. 

It's a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can't ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero.

Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me.

Edit2: So this blew up and I've seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I'm going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. 

I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. 

That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don't be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can't get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years. If you traveled for a year after college summarize what skills you acquired; you can adapt to new environments easily, you work well with a diverse team, etc. If you provided end of life care you learned a lot of responsibility you deal with stress and difficult conditions well. If you spent your 2 years unemployed sniffing glue in your moms basement I can't help you besides telling you to lie but as a manager I just want to know that you did something valuable with your time.

In fewer words don't leave your employment gap up to my imagination I'm cynical enough to fill it in with glue sniffing or prison. 

Also just to answer this line of inquiry that I have seen definitely leave rehab out I have 3 other people just as qualified as you sitting on my desk that didn't just tell me that they (used to) have an impulse control problem. I love second chances and all that but my job performance is partially determined by the quality of the team I hire, risks no matter how noble aren't in my best interest.",t2_dfaip,False,,1,False,ULPT: If you have a significant unexplained employment gap that is hurting your resume claim that you were providing full time end of life care for a grandparent (or other older relative).,[],r/UnethicalLifeProTips,False,7,,0,,False,t3_d5ixhz,False,light,0.95,,public,38166,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Careers &amp; Work,False,38166,,False,,1568774846.0,,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1568764369.0,text,7,,,text,self.UnethicalLifeProTips,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found this out because it actually was true in my case I had a 14 month employment gap after college so I could care for my grandfather who was dying from brain cancer. that gap has always hurt me when I explained it at an interview recently the interviewers entire opinion of me changed in her eyes that gap initially meant I was lazy and coasted for a year after college and once I told her I was caring for my grandfather she realized that her perception of the situation was wrong. After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can&amp;#39;t ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit2: So this blew up and I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I&amp;#39;m going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don&amp;#39;t be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can&amp;#39;t get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years.
