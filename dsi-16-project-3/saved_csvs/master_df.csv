LifeProTips,"You can use a simple algebra calculation to get a rough idea of how many words should be included in each section using the marking criteria. For example, the word count is 1500 words and there are 4 marking criteria or tasks. (Explain x, justify x, explain y, justify y)

If 50 marks are allocated to section 1, 10 to 2, and 20 to both 3 and 4. Then use this calculation: 50x+10x+20x+20x=1500. You can easily do this at  [https://www.mathpapa.com/algebra-calculator.html](https://www.mathpapa.com/algebra-calculator.html)

This gives x=15. So just multiply 15 by each sections allocated marks. So 50\*15=750 words for secion 1. 10\*15=150 words for section 2. 15\*20=300 for both sections 3 and 4.

Given your word limit, this should give you at least an idea of how many words to allocate to each section based off the possible marks achieved.

LifeProTips,"So I do a lot of white water sports and generally spend a lot of time on the water and I’ve heard/ seen too many stories of people who have only been in a pool or small pond and never been where they can’t just swim over to the shore. But they have never been in a bad situation on the water so they can’t handle it and they swim out in a river or lake that has a current or is just big and all of a sudden they are tired and the current is picking up the the shore it 100 yards away. 

I was on a class 3 rapid with some friends and we were canoeing and these two guys flipped and the two guys were fine but me and 3 others headed over to assist them and me and two of the people had been in water like that so we could hop eddies and such. The other person hadn’t been in water like that at all and they got halfway out there and grabbed a rock and panicked. They didn’t want to get off the rock and wouldn’t move. We did eventually talked her back to shore. That person stuck on the rock? She was a lifeguard. 

I promise you the water will win if you don’t know what your doing.

Please please don’t drown and read up on swift water safety so other don’t have to put their ass on the line for you.

Edit: I’m gonna add some tips but these are by no means a substitute for a professional teaching you.
The first is TRRG (throw row reach go) meaning that swimming is a last resort for saving someone and you should use a throw rope, paddle out there and try to reach them all before you get in the water.

NOSE AND TOES, meaning if you’re going down a rapid you keep you’re nose and toes above the water and toes facing down stream. You should float on your back going feet first because you would rather have your feet hit a rock then your head.

And lastly never and I mean never put your feet on the bottom when you are facing down stream. The reason is because the current will push your feet under a rock and you will not be able to pull them out and the current will rush over your back and push you on the bottom. A PFD will not save you in this situation.  if you absolutely need to put your feet down make sure you are standing backwards.",LPT: you are not as good at swimming as you think you are and you shouldn’t over estimate your skill,t3_iklgv8,0.93,13,14305,1599000029.0,iklgv8,667,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/iklgv8/lpt_you_are_not_as_good_at_swimming_as_you_think/,0,"LPT: you are not as good at swimming as you think you are and you shouldn’t over estimate your skill So I do a lot of white water sports and generally spend a lot of time on the water and I’ve heard/ seen too many stories of people who have only been in a pool or small pond and never been where they can’t just swim over to the shore.

LifeProTips,"I lost the ability to sing about 4 years years ago in a game of basketball. I was showing off making these tall dudes trip all over themselves. After doing this a few times one of them gave me a hard elbow to the throat. I kept playing but immediately noticed my voice was gone. It didn't come back for 4 days.

While my speaking voice returned, my ability to sing above a certain octave was decimated. I was never an amazing singer but I definitely could sing. My voice would now cut out completely as soon as I would try to hit any sort of high note.

Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago.. I'm in the car trying to sing, facing the usual problem of my voice cutting out, when I got frustrated and basically started pouting. With my mouth closed I started humming along to the music. After a couple of minutes I noticed that my throat was hurting exactly in the spot where I can feel my voice cut out. It occurred to me that I'm essentially working out that muscle.

Today I tried to sing a song on the radio while driving around and suddenly I noticed an ability to hit just 1 or 2 slightly higher notes. It's incredible. I never thought I'd be able to sing again.

LifeProTips,"This is inspired by me being downvoted for saying most people should be able to work out 18% of 50 very easily in their heads in a lifehack thread about how percentages are the same when flipped. The OP said ""18% of 50 seems hard but 50% of 18 seems easy"". I replied that it was a good tip but that most people should be able to work it out the other way very easily. How is it worked out easily? By realising that percentages are fractions of 100 and that 50 is half of 100. Everyone knows that 18% of 100 is 18, therefore everyone should know that 18% of 50 is just (18% of 100) divided by 2 = 9.

I still think that the majority of people should find that extremely easy, but most percentages are relatively easy to do in your head. 37% of 142 is pretty easy for me to do in my head since I know 10% is 14.2. 14.2 multiplied by 2 is 28.4. 28.4 multiplied by 2 is 56.8. That gives me 40%. Now I just work out 3% (and take that away from 56.8), which is 1% of 142 (1.42) multiplied by 3 (1.42...2.84....4.26). 56.8 - 4.26 = 52.54. I could work that out in my head in all of about 10 seconds without writing anything down. Some people are able to work it out quicker with that technique or even quicker using different techniques. 

I'd never be able to work that out if I just panicked and got scared by how hard it is (it's not), which is what I see a lot of people doing when it comes to basic maths like percentages. I get that numbers can be scary because they can ""expose a lack of intelligence"" but don't let that fear get in the way of seeing just how easy it is

LifeProTips,"I posted this in r/unpopularopinion and someone suggested I post it as a LPT. 

I'm really into good tasting meats (I'm a certified BBQ judge, compete in BBQ competitions, and really enjoy high quality beef and pork). I'm also lazy and impatient. Friends think I'm crazy when I reheat my meats in the microwave, but if done right, you can easily do it without ruining it and get similar quality results as the oven or stovetop.

Couple tips to do it well:

1. cut of the pieces into large bite sized chunks and only heat what you're going to eat at that time.
2. microwave power to around 20% (varies depending on the microwave)
3. stop the microwave every few seconds and move the plate or move the meat on the plate.
4. The more oil that's in the meat, the faster it will cook. In some cases, with a small amount of meat, it can be done in only about 10-15 seconds.
5. IMPORTANT: Only heat until it's fairly warm to the touch (about 130F if you're using a meat thermometer). You're only melting the oil, not making the piece of meat hot to the touch. Once it gets hot, the fibers start to contract and the meat will lose moisture.","LPT: Reheat a steak in the microwave without ruining it with low power, small pieces, turn often, and don't overheat it.",t3_iiwb1x,0.8,0,6,1598750565.0,iiwb1x,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/iiwb1x/lpt_reheat_a_steak_in_the_microwave_without/,0,"LPT: Reheat a steak in the microwave without ruining it with low power, small pieces, turn often, and don't overheat it.

LifeProTips,"Like the rest of Reddit, I love cats, especially their beautiful eyes. When I pet my cats, I used to look into their eyes while petting them, because I, as an evolved primate, feel eye contact is a sign of intimacy. 

For my cats, however, especially before they knew me well, this sent some very mixed messages. Cats only stare into each other's eyes when they're trying to attack, challenge, or confront each other, so looking into their eyes and touching them can lead to confusion and stress for them. Doing this to a cat who doesn't know you is inviting them to scratch, bite, hiss, or otherwise freak the hell out, especially because they perceive you as another GIGANTIC cat that could wreck them with one half-strength motion of your arms.

If you want your feline friend to feel loved, gently avert your gaze from their eyes as you pet them, and they'll feel this strongly as affection. It will make them happier, and you can have even more warm and fuzzies knowing that you're loving on them the way that THEY like as well as the way YOU like. Making brief eye contact is okay, as long as you avert it before they do, because they feel that it's accidental. Also, you can check out their eyes if they're staring at something else, to get your kitty eye fix.

By the way, this is also why you get the intense stare when you've offended your cat in some way. They're trying to decide if you meant it as play or if you've changed your mind about them and want to kill them. If you stare them down in this moment, they're going to be experiencing full-on fight-or-flight, because they think that their giant feline friend had just gone murderous. You'll see them tuck their ears back, too, to present less of a target, since they expect you're about to use your ""claws"" and teeth to grab ahold of whatever part of them you can get ahold of to feast on their flesh. 

TL;DR: if you live your kitty, respect their interpretation of eye contact as aggression and avoid staring directly into their eyes for any prolonged period of time.

EDIT: I've heard all of your feedback. This was the explanation of received from both our vet and a friend who socialized ferals at a city animal shelter. My apologies if this is not as universal as I was led to believe. I've always found it useful and effective, including while volunteering at that shelter for a couple years.","LPT Cat owners, don't stare down your cat",t3_iisjhv,0.84,1,562,1598737199.0,iisjhv,121,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/iisjhv/lpt_cat_owners_dont_stare_down_your_cat/,0,"LPT Cat owners, don't stare down your cat Like the rest of Reddit, I love cats, especially their beautiful eyes.

LifeProTips,"Colonoscopy Prep

In light of a Chadwick Bosemans passing a lot of you might be thinking about getting a colonoscopy done. I have Crohn’s disease and have had to do a few of them in the last 5 years and though I would offer some advice for what to experience. 

You might need to do prep where you drink this terrible overly salty liquid, the one I do also tastes like fruit punch. You probably think the flavouring helps, your very wrong. Here’s a few things I do to make drinking it a little better:

1. Make sure the liquid is cold, it helps a bit

2. Chop up a lemon into wedges and rub it ALL over your tongue to try to counter the salty taste. I also like to keep the lemon by my nose as I find the smell helps with the smell from the liquid

3. To drink the liquid you are going to want a straw that comes with bubble tea, they are about a centimetre in diameter. You want to place the straw at the very back of your mouth and then try to drink as much of the liquid before you taste it. The second you get a taste stop drinking and put the lemon on your tongue. 

4. Repeat till the liquid is gone. 


Also from the prep you are going to be shitting liquid out your ass for hours, sound fun? You will want to drink as much water as you can because if you’re dehydrated they will have trouble getting an IV in you the next day. 

The colonoscopy itself is not very hard. When you wake up and you feel like you need to fart ask to go to the bathroom. The nurse will tell you to just fart but for me personally it’s always been my body expelling the lube they used for the scope, go to the bathroom and sit there for a few minutes to let the lube get out of you. 

Now your done for the day and you can go eat the best meal of your life. 

Hope this helps anyone thinking about doing a colonoscopy. 

Rest in Power Chadwick

LifeProTips,"Disclaimer: This advice is mostly intended for massive infestations. Fairly clean locations might as well stick to conventional bug sprays as necessary.

Take an empty large metal coffee can, spray the inside of it with cooking oil, and drop some scrap food like bread or pizza crust in the bottom of the can. Then place it in infested areas in the kitchen or wherever they thrive, and they will come for food, but won't be able to crawl out past the oil (and apparently 99% of them are too stupid to know they can fly until their wings get covered in oil).

They will feast themselves to death in the trap can, and it only takes maintenance every week or so. Most of the roaches will actually die on their own as they wiggle and squirm around each other, covering themselves and each other with oil, but the most recent ones on top will probably still be alive.

For maintenance and trap cleaning, spray just a little poison in the can to kill the fresh surviving stragglers on top, then flush them down the toilet or dump them into a fire. After that, wash the can out thoroughly, apply more cooking oil and put some more bait bread in there.

After the first round or two, I bet you see very few roaches running around the house, most will have been caught in the can. Poisons let them go back into the walls, my can trap keeps them from going 'home'.

It's not rocket science, we do have bigger brains for a reason.

LifeProTips,"Like the title says, ""cultural appropriation"" is neither inherently a good or bad thing. At its core, it is simply the adoption of aspects of one culture by members of another culture.

LifeProTips,I was ~$300 over drafted on my checking. Called customer service for my huge nationwide bank and asked what options I had to fix this instead of covering it with my next payroll deposit. They offered $68 fee credit and they said they can’t do anymore that that. They suggested I call collections for a payment plan.  Called collections and they said they’re waive all the fees if my next deposit covered the overdraft. It would show up as a credit 2 business days later but I’d still get my money back after the deposit covered the over draw. I told em hell yeah! I worked in collections and this made sense.

LifeProTips,"Mud pits are ridiculously hard to escape. The more you try to get out, the more you get stuck. Mud gets in the tread of the tire and it feels impossible to escape. If you’ve seen someone who can’t swim splashing around in water and unable gain control, that’s what it feels like in your car minus the chance of drowning. You need 2 people to do this successfully in my experience; theoretically you can do it with one person.


Step 1: Be calm and assess the situation. It sounds obvious but the reason I say this is because everyone’s first instinct is “if I can’t drive forward, I’m going to reverse”. That literally makes the situation worse when mud is involved and after doing it long enough, you make something that could take 5 mins into something that can take 45 mins. If you switch between forward and reverse and cannot escape within a minute, you’re stuck. Move to step 2.


Step 2: Put all of your available floor mats under or as close to the wheels. Try your best to really push it in and under. If you’re on a hill and the front of your car is in the direction of the downward slant, the mats go in front of all 4 wheels. Apply the same logic to any other variation of car position and topography.


Step 3: Have the smaller person press the gas, the heavier person pushes the car from behind. At this point, you should continuously be reversing and driving forward with the intent of rolling over the mats. Coordinate with each other to prevent any accidents. As soon as you are free, drive to a surface without mud.


My ex and I were visiting my brother at Uni. The school had an area for families to park on a field. It had rained earlier that day and we arrived hours after everyone else had left, so the ground was already wet and softened. I went to his dorm to say bye and 10 mins later discovered that I was stuck. This small segment of a Les Stroud documentary worked its way into my memory, though doing this was a lot harder than the way he made it sound in a 10 second sound bite.","LPT: If your car is ever stuck in snow or mud, put your floor mats under your tires to gain traction.",t3_ihl86j,0.96,0,581,1598564498.0,ihl86j,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ihl86j/lpt_if_your_car_is_ever_stuck_in_snow_or_mud_put/,0,"LPT: If your car is ever stuck in snow or mud, put your floor mats under your tires to gain traction.

LifeProTips,"I have been seeing a good number of threads about what to do about insurance/accidents, but I never really see this one being addressed:  ***Underinsured insurance***.  Many states have a requirement for insurance limits, and it differs state to state.  In my particular state, the minimum barely covers a fender bender.  Uninsured is often required by law (in US states), but *underinsured* is not.  Therefore, many people drive around thinking they are covered until... well, they are not...  And, it's not always common sense to think about it...

***Uninsured:***  This covers you in the event that someone who does not carry insurance causes damage to your vehicle and/or bodily harm.  There are limits.

***Underinsured:***  This covers the differential in the event that someone who does not carry enough insurance causes damage to your vehicle and/or bodily harm.

A few years ago, my wife was hit head-on by an irresponsible kid who was driving 100+mph on the wrong side of the road.  The kid caused a 4 car accident.  I happened to be on the same road and happened upon the accident right after my wife was taken out in an ambulance.  She had been hit, rolled 4 times, and struck a pole.  The police on site instructed me to get her information from the vehicle and showed absolutely no concern for where she was or if she was even ok.  I had to climb through the wreckage to collect her belongings- purse, phone, everything was strewn out along the hill she was rolled down.  There was blood, there was hair, it was awful, and I still didn't even know where she was.  I gave the info to the police, thanked them for being heartless, put my fist into the kid's windshield, and left.  When I got to the ER, my wife was in a wheelchair and hadn't even been admitted yet, though the kid that caused the accident had been (hmm).  The next 3 months were absolute hell.  

It turns out, the kid had state minimum insurance.  25/50.  This means there was a total of $25k for property damage and $50k for medical to be split among all victims.  Our vehicle alone was $45k and we only had it for 9 months.  We had underinsured on all vehicles... except hers for some reason (Which I later found was a clerical error when insurance was switched during a trade-in, my fault for not catching it).  We were offered a settlement of $17k for her vehicle.  Her medical bills came up to $70k (we weren't even done at that point) and we were offered $15k there.  That left us with $83k worth of bills, and due to the extremely slow nature of insurance, the medical bills started to automatically route through our personal health insurance.  What a mess.  The ambulance-chaser law firms wouldn't bother with us since it was a limits issue.  It took 5 months to resolve, and we had to route it all through our own insurance and accept the measly settlements from the other insurance company to supplement it.  In the end, we still lost thousands and thousands of dollars.  My wife had health issues for two years which we had to pay out of pocket.  The lovely legal system charged the kid less than $100, and within a month he was driving a vehicle under someone else's name. 

* Learn your state's insurance laws
* Review your insurance types and limits
* Make sure your coverage protects your assets for any circumstances
* If you are driving around with state minimum (which I personally consider to be irresponsible), consider getting more coverage and drive as defensively as you possibly can- one slip up can carry a massive cost, and others aren't as friendly as I was.","LPT: If your state has a ridiculously low legal minimum for auto insurance, consider getting underinsured insurance...

LifeProTips,"First: avoid this technique if you are pregnant or suffer a heart disease!

Second, here's the technique: breathe a normal breath in, then out, and pinch your nose while you hold your breath. While breath-holding, nod your head or start swaying side to side or walking. When a big air-hunger is created, stop moving and breathe in through your nose. You'll find your airways are clearing! Repeat five times for your nose to get completely unblocked. Continue breathing through your nose to avoid reversing back to that stuffy nose. 

I've known plenty of people who are unable to breathe through their nose because of a stuffy nose, be it because of allergies or deviated septums. If this is the case, I want to point out that you don't have to live that way. Mouth breathing is dangerous and leads to anxiety, bad rest, attention deficit and depression. Check out James Nestor, Steve Maxwell or Patrick McKeown for more free info. Breathe Right!

Edit: Glad to see people getting results. I'll add a few notes, since many people are asking.
Note 1: don't breathe through your mouth. Just keep it shut and relax into your nose breath.
Note 2: if your nose gets blocked again after a minute, find yourself a certified breathing coach because you might be a heavy breather. But don't sweat it, 50-70% of the population are according to the science, but learning proper breathing will probably fix most issues you are having. 
Note 3: if your problem is a deviated septum, search for Steve Maxwell and a technique called Rolfing. (I had misspelled the treatment). 
Note 4: if you repeat the technique many times, then do some long and powerful exhales afterwards to lower the acidity caused by the accumulated CO2.

Been between jobs for sometime and starting to feel depressed and unable to get out of bed. Then I hit on the idea of trying to do as many different tasks for eight minutes each for a total of a couple of hours. I ended up with twelve tasks that ranged from taking a shower to doing to gardening. Been doing this for four days now and my depression has lifted and I have been much more productive than I have been for a long while. By spreading out the tasks over a wide number of different areas and setting the bar of success so low, you not only do a ton of things but also feel a sense of accomplishment. You would be surprised at how much you can achieve in eight minutes and not only that, once you tick off all the tasks, you can return to any particular task and spend much more time on it, all the while knowing that whatever else happens, you have done a ton of useful stuff.

To give one example, you can fill a large bin liner with gardening waste in eight minutes. I’ve now done this four days in a row and every time I see the pile of waste go down, I feel a little bit happier. And because those tasks range from self-care (like taking a shower) to sorting out photographs, I’ve found myself tackling tasks that I used to put off and have never gotten around to doing.

LifeProTips,"In my experience, a lot of people think that asking a lot of questions and being actively involved in the conversation is the key to learning. This may be true at times depending on the audience. When you’re involved in the conversation you are less receptive to what is being said because you are already formulating your next question or statement. This goes for if you have a lot of experience or little to no experience in the topic of conversation.

If you have a lot of experience and are in conversation with less experienced individuals you will be able to answer most questions or present facts about the topic. This inhibits you from possibly learning from less experienced individuals in the conversation. This also inhibits an in depth discussion that could be had by the less experienced to try and collectively figure out the answer. 

If you have no experience and feel the need to talk a lot in the conversation you are most likely not contributing anything of value and therefore not learning. If you control the conversation with questions then you are forcing the content of the conversation and do not get the chance to absorb what might be said if you remained silent.

LifeProTips,"I discovered this trick a few months ago when I was driving a considerable distance and my windshield wiper just happened to break.

As my luck would have it, it starts down pouring while I’m in the absolute middle of nowhere. So I luckily pass a church and pull over into the parking lot. Sitting there trying to figure out what to do, I look down and see a hair tie on my gear shift. Then I start thinking of all the random stuff I have in my car. 

I found a pair of socks and get out of my car to try to finagle a makeshift windshield wiper. I wadded up the sock and fastened it with the hair tie into what I’m sure looked totally ridiculous to the cars I passed. 

As wild as it probably looked, that sock wiper held up for a few days until I got home to replace the actual wiper blade.

If a seller or buyer is trying to scam you, you’re in a safe place to voice concern and not be out in the open or at your home where a confrontation may go bad and you have no safety net.

LifeProTips,"We've all had this happen to us, where you can visibly see that someone you care about is not okay.

Given how important mental health is, especially these days with the current circumstances, it's important that we talk through our issues and negative feelings.

LifeProTips,"I’ve shared this trick among friends and thought it might be of use here. I’ve had Facebook for 12 years and have over 800 friends but I’ve always hated the mental baggage of social media. Scrolling through an endless ‘news’ feed with posts that illicit envy, outrage or isolation. 

ANYWAY. About two years ago I unfollowed all of my friends NOT unfriend them. Working through the news feed I clicked the little arrow on the right of every post in my news feed and clicked unfollow.  This took the most time, a few hours. 

Next, I went to pages and unliked every page.

Groups next. I left every group I was a part of except for two motorbike groups and a small handful of buy/sell/swap groups. I unfollowed these groups so they don’t show on my newsfeed, forcing me to navigate to them rather then mindlessly reaching for Facebook to use the news feed.

Lastly, I deleted the Facebook app and added the Facebook URL to the Safari browser on my iPhone with Adguard VPN and Safari privacy protection enabled. No parasitic drain on my battery, no push notifications or spyware associated with having the app. 

So what perks are left? Messenger, invites for events, tagging me in photos, a small handful of useful/healthy groups and ability to search up friends if they have travel photos. 

I always see posts on Reddit telling people to delete social media but it does have its uses and hope this too serves you all well. Especially with all the hate and lies perpetuated during this pandemic. 

TL;DR - unfollow all friends, unlike all pages, leave almost all groups, delete app and set Facebook URL as a bookmark on your internet browser for casual use.

But my wife and I got in a car accident last year. I split my head open and got a concussion and got staples in my head. Head injuries bleed a lot, and my wife was smart enough to pull out her phone and snap a couple of gruesome pictures of me with blood sheeting down my face.

Fast forward to now, and my wife mentioned sort of off-hand to our lawyer that we had pictures from the scene. He immediately took them and sent them to the adjuster and today we got their new offer which had almost doubled the money we’d take home.

LifeProTips,"Current/former flight attendant here! I just recently travelled as a regular passenger and had to go through TSA for the first time in almost 4 years. Airlines are not really doing cart service or snack and beverage services so I figured I would be my own flight attendant.

Pack your own snacks in a separate container/bag per TSA guidelines listed [here!](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/food) Save the big bucks. This is an extra great tip if you’re travelling with a bunch of kids. I believe they do have to be packed separate so for your own sake, don’t pack it in your roller suitcase. Also, things have to be sealed so resist snack temptation. Anything liquid still has to be under 3.4 ounces. I usually do either a little lunch bag or plastic grocery bag.

LifeProTips,"My friend's mother suggested this when I was in high school.  I found it so life changing and beneficial, that it became a personal rule.  Each new school year, I'd find the office hours of every teacher or authority figure at my school (and later my university) and proceed to drop in their offices one by one just to shoot the breeze.

I made it a point to come in with no requests or criticism of any kind.  I just said I wanted to thank them for their lesson/guidance/management and, when applicable, point out what I enjoyed about their classes.  I also tried to get to know their interests and hobbies

It's obviously very important you are aware of the person's time and that you do not intrude.  Keep your introduction short and to the point.  Instructors and managers are busy. This needs to be enjoyable for both parties.  However, don't let that scare you, they are people, too.

I could see that, for many of my instructors, this was totally novel and refreshing to them.  They were not used to students just dropping by without an agenda. In fact, some didn't believe me for a while.  I remember one art teacher asking 4 or 5 times what I really needed.   However, you could see the physical change in their face and posture when they saw the visit as a friendly gesture.  They were so amused by the gesture.  

Obviously, this was extremely beneficial if I ever needed real help or guidance, my teachers were always more willing to help.  I can remember once when I was falsely accused of something  at high school and my principal immediately dismissed the accusation in the head office.  He said, ""That's not the kind of student he is.""  I was never even pulled in, a secretary ended up telling me this.  Teachers would also engage me a lot in class because I was slightly more familiar to them than my classmates.  I also knew which teachers were going to be hard to work with and I had ideas on how to approach them. 

I made a lot of lifelong friends like this.  I'm a teacher now myself, but I still maintain contact with some of these individuals.  Also, I make it a point to meet people in this same way still.  

These little visits were great practice for my adult life as well.  I got lots of interpersonal communication practice and learned how to have a formal but relaxing conversation with a superior.

I suggest this to all young people.  Think of it as an upgraded version of bringing an apple to class.  Go meet you teachers and make friends BEFORE you need help.

LifeProTips,"I live on a street with ongoing construction work and often wear earplugs to drown out the annoying noise. But when repairs are being done in my own building, the vibrations from hammers or mallets reverbates from wall to wall and makes it hard to think, let alone study or work. I hate that kind of noise and have tried every kind of earplug I could find, but sometimes they're just not enough. What I've found recently is that listening to white noise with earplugs can seriously drown it. There are YouTube videos and also apps with the sounds of rain, thunderstorms, a fan or just white noise that you can combine so it's most effective, and then you can just put up the volume until it's all you hear and the annoying noise is gone.

LifeProTips,"For maybe the past 5 years now, whenever I get close enough to someone that I feel like I'm going to be regularly buying them gifts (for birthdays or holidays mostly) I make an empty list in my phone with their name on the top.

LifeProTips,"Even if it's just to catch up or say hey.
Even if you think they *should* already have your number ""from last time.""

I thought of this because this just happened to me the other day. My phone has gone through many info-deletions including a massive chunk of contacts, due to software reasons. I don't have tons of numbers I used to.

A random number with an area code I definitely did not recognize sent me a text out of the blue and all it said was **""Nikki?""**

It immediately made me suspicious and put me on guard. 
I googled the whole phone number and it was from a state many states away from me, where I don't know anyone that lives there.

After a bit of silence I decided to send **""?""**

To which they instantly replied **""Nikki Lastname?""**

So now I'm really like *Wtf is this.*

I didn't reply. **They then text ""It's Smelborp if so.""**
*(Name changed for privacy)*

So now I'm wrestling with replying or not. Yeah I really only know ONE Smelborp but he didn't say his last name so it could be a trick. I think, if I just say ""Smelborp who?"" it might give them the impression that I am in fact this Nikki Lastname they were searching for.

But if I don't reply, what if it's actually my old friend? 

I thought, there's really no way to reply to this without in one way or another agreeing that I am this Nikki Lastname.

I ended up just calling the number directly and it really was an old friend of mine. But I very strongly considered not replying at all and blocking the strange number.


So if you're wanting to reach out to someone but you're not sure that the number you have is theirs still, your best bet would be to be open and clear from the first message. If he said ""Is this Nikki? This is Smelborp Forpresident."" I totally would've replied no problem.

LifeProTips,"I have lived in 9 properties in 10 years and with the most recent 3 properties, I have done these three things on moving day. It makes me feel more secure and more 'at home'. These will seem obvious to some, but not to everyone!

1. Change all locks. Front door, back door, window locks (if there are any - but actively look for them). Costs up to £15 for most locks and they're easy to refit or you can hire a professional if you prefer. This will cost more, but trust me, the cost is more than worth it for your piece of mind. Anyone could have a copy of the key for the lock.

Note: I'm unable to change the title but this might all cost more than £50 in total depending on how many locks you have to replace! Still worth it though!

If you're renting, tell your landlord/letting agent that you are doing this - they generally don't mind as long as you agree to give them a replacement key (as they always keep a spare in their office).

2. Change the toilet seat. Don't feel like you're in a public bathroom at home! Simple, effective and again, shouldn't cost more than £15 /$/€. It's really easy to change them and it's a good feeling afterwards.

3. Change the shower head. Again, really cheap, really easy and gives you that peace of mind 'new home' freshness. Shower heads build up bacteria and if it hasn't been changed in years, or hasn't been used for a couple of weeks if the property has been vacant, this is especially important. As you have no way of knowing how long it has been sitting there, just change it!

In my experience, you can do these three things for less than £100 (depending on how many locks there are or if you hire someone) and in less than an hour.

Bonus notes: spend some time vacuuming (especially before putting down large pieces of furniture you don't plan on moving again, like the bed) and use antibacterial spray on the kitchen sides and in cupboards.

LifeProTips,"In my opinion understanding your budget and cash flow is step one of starting a life of financial comfort. 

Let’s say your starting off from the beginning. Fresh out of high school and you landed a job making $1000/month. Your expenses are around $550 and you have $450 in free cash flow. This example is not focused on amounts of income, but the concept of free cash flow. 

People start out of high school/college with no debts or responsibilities aside from normal living expenses. They get their first job or promotion and realize they have free cash flow every month and think to themselves “I can afford a BMW cause I have $450 a month free now”. 

What they don’t realize is they could have used the extra money to save towards something else, even if that something else is paying cash for your BWM. It’s almost always better to pay cash for something unless you know for certain that you can make better return on an investment than the % you pay on the loan. The stock market doesn’t provide that certainty. It’s almost always better to pay cash for the car.

What that means is you really can’t afford that BMW that only costs $450/month. You could save up for a year or two and pay cash for a decent older car with low miles. It’s best to just pay cash, don’t finance something that’s not your home, while it may not cost you in interest with today’s low interest rates. The opportunity cost of the missed cash flow will be higher than you think. 

Now let’s say you have some free cash flow and you’re ready to save what’s next? This is a pivotal question because if you don’t identify a goal it’s very easy to get off track and use free cash flow for leisure or wasteful things. 

If you don’t already have it, your first goal is $1000 in your checking account, this is your new $0. No overdraft fees anymore no worrying if you can cover 90% of unexpected things. If you feel more comfortable with $5000. Be my guest. That’s your call. This is a huge step and should not be looked at in a bad light, everyone saves their first $1000 at some point and that’s something to be proud of. 

Next is your emergency fund. This should be 6-9 months of expenses every month, multiply your required monthly costs by 6, or 9 on the safe side. This number includes groceries, rent, utilities, phone, gas, etc. Your emergency fund doesn’t get used for anything unless you need it and you didn’t get to plan for it (new transmission, vet bill, *lost your job*.....that’s the big one)

To make these numbers more applicable to a normal scenario, if your income is $3000/month with expenses of $1,650, and a free cash flow of $1,350, then your emergency fund is between $10,000 and $15,000. This sounds daunting, but we’re planning a life here not buying a plasma TV. 

Now that you have your emergency fund it’s time to start planning for your house, rental property, vacation, or your BMW if your still focused on that. Determine how much you need and start saving/investing. 

How you approach saving/investing depends heavily on the timeframe. Anything within 2 years should be saved in safe investments, high yield savings accounts, CDs, etc. anything beyond that should be invested with varying levels of risk depending on the goal. 

If your goal is a home you first identify the cost of home you want. The rule everyone wants to use is 10% down. I’m on the side of 20% down. You don’t lose this money, you still have it in home value, it just lowers the monthly mortgage expense, which circles back to our best friend......cash flow. 

Now I know you’re thinking wait a minute 20% down? I want a $500,000 house. That’s $100,000!!! I can’t save up $100,000! That’s where you’re wrong. I’m saying save up $115,000. You still need your emergency fund, especially moving into a new house. 

When you decide when you will be able to move into your house you start investing. First discover the amount per month you need to save, over how many years. Let’s say $100,000 for your down payment over 5 years. Saving $20,000/year comes out to just under $1,700(assuming no growth) per month (roughly the 30 year mortgage on your new house at today’s rates). Unfortunately also the rent you’ll have to pay without a house. That’s the American dream. 

Start tossing your $1,700 a month in a brokerage account and consult with a financial advisor for a specific recommendation on your goal/risk tolerance. Many of the big name brokerage companies offer free advisory services, or a reasonable fee for the services provided, shop around. 

Once you’ve accomplished your goal it’s time to start planning for your next goal. Choose something new and repeat. Always budget in a portion of your income to savings. Never over spend. Don’t just invest in stocks; real estate and other businesses offer good returns with different styles of risks. The housing market doesn’t always crash with the stock market. 

Be sure to always keep the emergency fund and keep the cash a flowin, best of luck everyone. This is a marathon not a sprint. I’m on probably year 5-6 of a 15-20 year plan I have. Everyone starts somewhere.

LifeProTips,"Here's a piece of all ages advice.

So most of us have spent some amount of time worrying that we're not attractive and no one will want us in ""that"" way. Because hey, we all have some certain set of flaws with our bodies or our faces, right?

But here's the thing I finally figured out. For each kind of a flaw that you might have, there is some certain set of people out there who literally just don't care at ALL about that flaw (or maybe even like it better).

And even if you think you have a *number* of flaws, there's still *some* number of people out there who don't give a shit about *any* of those things at all.

And so get this, to those people's eyes, who don't see the flaws -- you're a ""ten"". They're not ""settling"" for you. You're just the hottest fucking thing they've ever seen.

And there's more of them than you think.

So forget about the flaws and get busy being your hot as fuck self.

LifeProTips,"I somehow turned on Advance Protection with Google and got locked out of my account with Google. After some research, I found out that the absolute only way to get it unlocked is to file an Account Recovery ticket and wait 3 days for Lily to respond with an e-mail letting you know she needs more information, but will not tell you what information is needed.

I pay for YoutubeTV and Google One and I can't access either and can't manage or access the accounts. My credit card information is apparently not an accepted form of identifying information. I pay for Google One which is supposed to get you a ""higher"" level of support and the only thing they say is they don't have access to account recovery and that I just need to keep requesting my account be unlocked.

I feel like I am taking crazy pills. This huge company has absolutely no way to be contacted. It doesn't matter what information you have they will not unlock it. I immediately purchased a Microsoft 365 account to backup everything I could and will never use Google for anything ever again that is important and I would recommend you do not either. Apple at least has local stores and Microsoft has actual customer service lines. 

TLDR: Google can lock your account, keep you from ever accessing it again, keep you from accessing your payment information that is paying for any of their services, and there is no one you can talk to about it and they don't care at all. I can't access my YoutubeTV, Google One, and I will lose every app/movie/game/service I ever purchased through Google. Please don't make my mistake.

First, thanks a lot for the few people who gave their time to help out a stranger.

To keep it short. What I ended up with that works is imagining these people doing silly things. Works even on my family.

Real life situation: my parents' neighbor is a talker. Especially when he's buzzed. He also thinks he's hilarious. Maybe, but for me he's boring. He tells me this boring story about his dog.

I imagined him getting on the ground and barking like he's a dog, then his dog starts humping him from behind, while barking. I couldn't hold it and laughed a little. He though I liked his story. It was a genuine small laughter, just not at his story. You can tell if someone fakes it. It was real, because was, real. He didn't know that and I probably made his day.

The more ridiculous the better. My dad was eating his boogers. I didn't argue with my brother this time. Hard to do so when someone's cleaning naked with a broom up their ass. And the employee? Ou. Em. Gee. She's done everything. I'm getting good at this.

LifeProTips,"GRAPES stands for ""guns, religion, abortion, politics, economics and sexuality."" These topics often relate to people's core beliefs. Open-minded, curious, educated people are often (but not always) willing to have a thoughtful, spirited discussion on these and other topics and are willing to accept reasoned differences of opinion with grace. Other people, however, may immediately brand you as a villain as a result of your differing viewpoint.

For example, if you disagree with someone's stance on guns, you might either be deemed a violent, low-information redneck or a big-government lackey trying to trample God-given Second Amendment rights (if you're in the US).

If you disagree with someone's view on abortion, you might be labeled as either a baby murderer or a misogynistic enforcer of patriarchy.

The same potential for friendship-ending disputes exists within discussions on religion, politics, economics and sexuality. There are strong viewpoints on both (or all) sides of these arguments. Don't assume that the person you're talking to agrees with you, no matter how self-evident and indisputable your opinion seems to you.

There are exceptions. For example, if you're at a shooting range, you can probably have a nice debate on the precise scope of the Second Amendment, as long as you're relatively pro-gun rights. If you're in a Catholic church, you can pretty safely assume that the other members of the church are also Catholic.

Finally, if you want to have a deep, broad and meaningful relationship with someone, eventually you'll want to discuss some or all of these topics.

LifeProTips,"Today, I'd like to discuss things I've learned over the years from presenting to other people, by demonstrating the sandwich method, and how to go into detail about what you're discussing. 

I'd like to first describe the sandwich method. The sandwich method is a method of presentation where you state what you'll be talking about, then talk about it, and then close out with a summary of what you discussed. This helps prepare your audience to receive the information and digest it a little easier. The sandwich method also helps you present on multiple topics at once, by providing a clean organized outline to how your topics will flow in the beginning. It's very similar to a thesis for an essay, but I personally find it easier to imagine your presentation as being rough draft ready before you outline what you'll present on.

Now, I'd like to go into how to discuss important details. When you're creating a presentation, you already know the key points, but to emphasize those key points, you can list details that are directly related to those points, such as examples that are relevant, or figures you might specifically need to go over. Be sure you tailor these to your audience. For example, if you're a tech wizard in the middle of a room full of people who only have basic computer skills, you'll need to make sure that if you mention a specific technology, you specify how that will affect their day to day work flow. This helps keep the presentation informative but concise. Don't be afraid to flesh out details, but be sure they are relevant.

As you can see, using the sandwich method and discussing details properly helps your presentation flow smoothly. I hope these skills help you the next time you need to make a presentation for anywhere on your career path.","LPT: When Presenting, Use The Sandwich Method, And Discuss Important Details",t3_igj0cf,0.78,0,13,1598411952.0,igj0cf,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/igj0cf/lpt_when_presenting_use_the_sandwich_method_and/,0,"LPT: When Presenting, Use The Sandwich Method, And Discuss Important Details Today, I'd like to discuss things I've learned over the years from presenting to other people, by demonstrating the sandwich method, and how to go into detail about what you're discussing.

LifeProTips,"Body temperature may vary significantly between individuals. It is fairly easy to identify a ""standard"" fever: An early morning temperature higher than 37.2 °C (99.0 °F) or a late afternoon temperature higher than 37.7 °C (99.9 °F) is normally considered a fever. 

However, you may be running a low grade or borderline fever and everything would seem normal and within acceptable ranges to yourself and a physician if you are not aware of your baseline. Considering also the COVID-19 context, it's very important to have this awareness, as fever can also be measured as  1.1°C above the person's usual value.

Let's say your usual value is 36.2C - at 37.3C it would still be in what are considered normal ranges, but you would in fact be running a fever. 

The method should be the same and preferably with the same thermometer (oral, axillary, tympanic or rectal) as ranges differ with type of measurement as well. 

Internal measurements (e.g. rectal) are considered more accurate as they are less likely to be influenced by external factors.

Couple of years ago,  I went in to my doctor's office for wellness visit and lab work.  In  US, your wellness preventative visit is supposed to be free once a year.  I received a bill from Labcorp for $386 the following  week and found out my insurance only covers lipid panel not the other labs ordered.   The doctor had ordered complete metabolic panel (CMP), blood panel (CBC) and thyroid panel (TSH) which was not covered by insurance.

My employer had  recently changed insurance to this crappy company who thinks labwork is not necessary for wellness visits. This was news to me since I had no issues with my previous insurance. They also informed me that lipid panel is only covered every 4 years (thanks for the heads up, so won't be covered next year) and advised I should take their preventative handout to my doctor so he doesn't order anything that will get charged.

Here I am paying $800/month for my family medical coverage who refuses to cover basic labwork and wants to dictate to the doctor what needs to be done for MY healthcare without incurring any costs.

I was pissed and reached out to my state attorney general, they followed up, went back and forth with  legal dept of insurance company ( around 3 months), case was forwarded to their expert panel and finally got a bill for $36.  Still not happy to pay it, but this ordeal was wasting too much time and very grateful that attorney general took upon my case to deliver results.

LifeProTips,"If you find yourself working harder for other people than you do your own self interests, I've found these things help restore balance:

1. Track all of your work time with an app/log of some kind. You need to know how much you're working to keep it in check.  

2. Always work for at least 15 minutes at one thing before you pick up the next, and keep the time tracked as such. This is especially helpful if you have multiple work projects going on. You'd be surprised how much time you lose doing one-minute tasks that you don't track, and how distracting it is to constantly switch between tasks. (Even 15 minutes is too short, IMO).  

3. In that SAME app/log, \*\*\*add your own projects/life stuff\*\*\*. Don't get too granular - I have three projects, for home improvement, wellness, and hobbies. TRACK YOUR TIME DOING THOSE THINGS the same way you track your work stuff.

Doing this has helped me perceive time spent on my own life as being just as important/valuable as time spent working for others. Literally working for my own self-interest.

LifeProTips,"Say I want to wake up around 7AM. I also know with my body, I need at least 7 hours of sleep. Sleep cycles are usually 90min on average. It also takes the average human 14 minutes to fall asleep. The best rest I will get is not going to bed at midnight, but rather near 11:15PM. I will *fall asleep* near 11:30, and get 5 full sleep cycles before waking up.

LifeProTips,"I recently read about the news of 13 people dying in a Peru disco due to a stampede caused by the police raid.

 Stampedes are horrifying to say the least and getting caught up in one can be extremely dangerous.

I always try to be very cautious when I am in crowded places, here are some important things that you should keep in mind:

1. First of all avoid being at any crowded place where the exit options are not sufficient for the crowd.


2. Stay on your feet. 


3. Conserve Energy, don't push against the crowd, don't yell or scream and don't PANIC.


4. Use sign language to communicate with those around you (point, wave, even use your eyes)


5.Keep your hands up by your chest, like a boxer – it gives you movement ,protects your chest and allows you to breathe easily even if people are presseing against you.

6.Try to move away from choke points as they are the worst place to be.

7. Evaluate your surroundings and  make sure you know where all the exits are at.
 
8. Do not Resist the force of the crowd, rather move diagonally with the flow and that will leave you to the edge of the stampede where its less likely to be stuck at a choke point.

LifeProTips,"I worked at a pub and got mentioned by name in a review. My manager was not really around so cannot see the work I do but after seeing the positive review he was really happy with me.

I also used this at a job interview when they asked for an example of when I have delivered great customer service.

Edit: this is UK and I didn't ask for a raise or was rewarded with one, I'm just saying never ask for a raise unless you can back it up with a reason why you should get one. Those positive reviews are worth a lot especially to independent/small businesses... You get companies that pay thousands for fake reviews and it also get companies that sue people literally take them to court for leaving a bad review and they sometimes win thousands in compensation!

I have read your comments and I get it you can't get a raise as a server (hopefully that is just USA)... my point was that regardless of where you work reviews are valuable and make you stand out...

I also used this at a job interview when they asked for an example of when I have delivered great customer service.

Edit: this is UK and I didn't ask for a raise or was rewarded with one, I'm just saying never ask for a raise unless you can back it up with a reason why you should get one. Those positive reviews are worth a lot especially to independent/small businesses... You get companies that pay thousands for fake reviews and it also get companies that sue people literally take them to court for leaving a bad review and they sometimes win thousands in compensation!

I have read your comments and I get it you can't get a raise as a server (hopefully that is just USA)... my point was that regardless of where you work reviews are valuable and make you stand out... So leaving a review can make a person stand out and even help them with their career.",2020-08-25 13:50:53-04:00,2020-08-25,13:50:53,receive great service restaurant want leave positive review sure mention server small gesture help come negotiation pay rise help stand job interview work pub get mention review manager work see positive review happy job interview ask example deliver great customer service edit uk didn ask raise reward m say ask raise reason positive review worth lot especially independent small business company pay thousand fake review company sue people literally court leave bad review win thousand compensation read comment raise server hopefully usa point regardless work review valuable stand leave review person stand help career

LifeProTips,"Before I start, I want to say up until the age of 20, I had read at most three full books of my own accord and they were all before I was 12. Most books in school I just Sparknoted or got summaries from my friends. I've always loved learning but just could not tolerate sitting down with a book. Recently though with quarantine, I started reading and my entire world has changed.

WHY: First of all, books are a tremendous amount of work to conceptualize, write, and publish. That alone sets a huge barrier against people just writing nonsense or lazily thought out ideas which the internet is riddled with. Most books are the result of careful meticulous thought and writing and regardless of what subject or story you decide to read on, you can be pretty sure you are getting a strong take on it. 

WHAT TO READ: Literally everything and anything is good. Literature, poetry, philosophy, history, natural/social sciences, geography, any arbitrary intersections of the above, etc. The world is really vast and any subject could literally fill entire libraries. Currently,  I'm reading this book called ""Eighth day of creation"" by Judson about the history of the 20th century revolution in genetics (fantastic read).

HOW: For people like me who are slow at reading or don't have the attention span, honestly, trust me, you don't or aren't. Reading is a muscle and by just reading more you WILL get faster and better and it will most certainly help your concentration elsewhere. Also, meditating before reading helps me a lot.","LPT: If you really want to revolutionize your intellect, start reading",t3_ifzu1f,0.78,1,73,1598338147.0,ifzu1f,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/ifzu1f/lpt_if_you_really_want_to_revolutionize_your/,0,"LPT: If you really want to revolutionize your intellect, start reading Before I start, I want to say up until the age of 20, I had read at most three full books of my own accord and they were all before I was 12.

1. If you’re laying in bed and you can’t fall asleep you’ll keep yourself awake with the anxiety of not being able to fall asleep.  Try doing a boring activity like drinking some tea, writing in a journal, reading a boring book, etc. then try again. 

2.Absolutely no phones! Best 30min-1hr before bed

3. No napping through out the day, no matter how tired you are. 

4. Wake up and go to sleep at the same time 

5. No eating/drinking (other than water) two hours before bed 

6. Take a shower/bath before bed 

7. Don’t watch something that will give you anxiety before going to sleep like the news, documentaries, horror movies

LifeProTips,"As we are in the dead of summer in many parts of the world and with many of us under a heat wave, you may be wondering how you can cool your living space without running your AC constantly.

1. Freeze a couple gallons of water your freezer would be freezing anyways, if you don't have a freezer, you can pick some up at the store, at a hotel (another LPT in itself), or ask a neighbor.
2. Use a fan to direct the air onto the ice. If you can somehow enclose the fan and ice, directing more of the output of the air onto the ice, it will work even more efficiently.
3. Cycle out the ice once it melts. (bonus points, if you freeze the ice in a bottle, you now have cold water you can drink!)

**Cost Savings** ([source](https://20somethingfinance.com/cost-of-air-conditioning-vs-a-fan/))

* Standalone Fan - around $1 / month
* Window AC Unit - around $50 / month
* Central AC Unit - around $130 / month

**Other Potential Benefits**

* Your AC filter may not be filtering virus particles (depending on your maintenance schedule, filter type, etc.). There is currently a shortage on the filter types capable of filtering out virus particles ([source](https://fortune.com/2020/07/21/air-filters-coronavirus-kill-viruses-hvac-supply-covid-19-heating-air-conditioning-indoor-spaces-merv-13-us-economy/)).

LifeProTips,"Keyboard shortcuts can save you a ridiculous amount of time.  In MS Office programs, such as Excel, Word, etc, you can use the \[ALT\] key to access commands without the mouse.

* Pick a command that you use often
* Hit the \[ALT\] key, you will see letters and numbers appear over the buttons in the command ribbon
* Type the corresponding letters/numbers to reach the command you are looking for
* Memorize the keystrokes to reach your most common commands
* Learn one a week and before long you will be whipping through the applications

I make a lot of fancy tables and formatting in Excel, so I have \[ALT\]HBY memorized to bring up the border draw options.  \[ALT\]HMC merges and centers cells, so that is also one I use often.  I keep a table of these commands/mapkeys on my bulletin board above my desk so I can quickly reference them.

In MS Office programs, such as Excel, Word, etc, you can use the \[ALT\] key to access commands without the mouse.

* Pick a command that you use often
* Hit the \[ALT\] key, you will see letters and numbers appear over the buttons in the command ribbon
* Type the corresponding letters/numbers to reach the command you are looking for
* Memorize the keystrokes to reach your most common commands
* Learn one a week and before long you will be whipping through the applications

I make a lot of fancy tables and formatting in Excel, so I have \[ALT\]HBY memorized to bring up the border draw options.  \[ALT\]HMC merges and centers cells, so that is also one I use often.  I keep a table of these commands/mapkeys on my bulletin board above my desk so I can quickly reference them.

LifeProTips,"It's a safe bet most of you reading this aren't getting enough sleep. (Yeah I'm talking to YOU reading this at 3 A M). Most adults need at least 8 hours, I need about 9. If I go to bed 8.5 hours before I need to get up, and my sleep and wake times are about the same as they've been for a few days, I will always reliably wake up at the correct time. To the minute. The only time I would use an alarm is if I need to wake up extra early, or have a really important reason to be absolutely sure to be up on time, like a plane flight. 

Sleep scientists use a simple measurement of whether someone is sleep deprived: have them lay in a darkened room with their eyes closed for ten minutes. If they don't fall asleep in that time, they are not sleep deprived. I'll bet nobody reading this could pass that test. Sure there are sleep disorders that make this more complicated, but most adults don't have a sleep disorder - they just stay up past their bedtime every single night. 

Most adults in the US are chronically sleep deprived, getting about 6.5 hours on average.

LifeProTips,"There are plant-based substitutes out there that are delicious, but there are more that aren’t. If all you can get is the crummy stuff, there are ways to make it taste much better. 

If you’re not vegan, pan-fry whatever you’re making in butter. The cheaper plant-based foods typically lack the saturated fats that give actual meat flavour. Adding a little bit of fat back makes a world of difference. I’ve done it with veggie burgers, butterflied sausages &amp; hot dogs, chick’n patties, and fake shredded “beef”. All of them were noticeably improved from just baking or frying with oil or non-stick spray.

If you’re vegan, use vegan butter instead. The added fat improves flavour and adds richness. Frying your product adds textural contrast with a little crunch and causes the sugars on the outside to caramelize and get tastier. 

If you’d rather improve your meat substitutes without adding fat, grilling is a great option. Veggie products can be a little  limp and sad, so a bit of crunch goes a long way in livening them up.

LifeProTips,"As a homeowner, I’ve collected a lot of tools, some of which have been a lot more useful than others. There are the basics - a good socket wrench set, drill and bit set, drop cords, etc - but there are a few others that I never thought about but am really glad I have when something happens and I have to do impromptu DIY home repair. 

Reciprocating saw
- whether it’s breaking down bulky wood or metal trash, pruning tree limbs, or quick &amp; dirty carpentry, if you need to cut it, this will probably do the job. 

Plumbers epoxy putty
- Saved god alone knows how much water damage and extra associated cost. Forget that tape, this will seal pinhole leaks in just about anything and cover you till you can get a plumber in. 

Wet/dry shop vac
- Don’t really need a big one, but if you’ve got a dry mess from sheetrock work or a water spill, this will get what would make your normal vacuum cry. 

Floor fan
- If you need a breeze to keep you cool inside or out, need to clear out smoke from that failed dinner experiment, or need to help clear paint fumes, you’ll be glad you have one. 

Voltage checker
- Whether you’re replacing a wall socket, light switch, or doing more in-depth repairs, it doesn’t matter if you’re pretty sure you’ve turned the breaker off.  Use one of these to verify there’s no electricity in that wire before you touch it. I won’t do any electrical work without one. 

Pressure washer
- Probably the most expensive thing on the list, but I was amazed at how much I ended up using it. From cleaning the car to cleaning the driveway and patio, you’ll save money over hiring someone to do it for you. 

Wet vacuum 
- If you have carpet, you need a regular vacuum but you’ll need one of these too. That goes triple if you have pets. I’m not a big fan of the automated ones, they seem to break down faster, but you WILL get spills on the carpet and furniture, and one of these WILL make your life easier.",LPT: Tools for the new homeowner,t3_if7fms,0.86,0,15,1598233172.0,if7fms,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/if7fms/lpt_tools_for_the_new_homeowner/,0,"LPT: Tools for the new homeowner As a homeowner, I’ve collected a lot of tools, some of which have been a lot more useful than others.

LifeProTips,"As many people know, a lot of new computers are filled with bloatware with unwanted garbage such as antivirus trials, movie editor trials, pointless games, etc. The best way to not deal with all of that is to just clean install Windows to a new computer from a flash drive, which will remove all of that garbage and will speed up your new computer, especially if it only has a hard drive (side LPT get an SSD in 2020 its worth it)

anyway:

Update: thanks to u/momentum77 for pointing this out, before reinstalling windows on a brand new machine, make sure to actually set up the original windows install and make it to the desktop before reinstalling, that way the Windows key will be activated so when you reinstall you wont get any activation issues

1. Search up “windows 10 media creation tool” on another pc (if you dont have another computer you can also do this process on the new computer) 
2. Download the tool from Microsoft
3. Plug in a flash drive (make sure its empty because everything will be deleted)
4. Follow the instructions on screen
5. Pop in the flash drive to the new pc
6. Go into the Bios and make sure to boot from the usb flash drive (this you will have to google or find a video on how to)
7. Follow the installation instructions for Windows
8. Enjoy a fresh windows install with little to no bloatware

LifeProTips,"Not sure if this is the right sub but this tip can help get your credit in order. The first step to building or fixing credit is to know where you stand. Here’s a copy and paste with a link to the site I’ve used for years to get my report. It’s required by law that you be able to access it. So I hope this helps anyone! It helped me a few times in my younger years and still when I need to use my credit on something big I pull my free report first. 


So I run across this a lot. Young or old people doesn’t matter. YOU ARE ENTITLED BY LAW TO GET A FREE CREDIT REPORT ONCE A YEAR. 

I know a lot of people wonder what their credit is or get sad when they get decline and don’t know what to do. 

First of all get an idea of what’s going on with your credit then start building it.  

A couple misconceptions about credit I see often are :

Just because you have a decent score does not mean you all of a sudden will get approved for everything. You still need an established history by a lot of people. Don’t think you need a second credit line? Think again. 

All debt effects your credit, if your grandma said, medical doesn’t do anything blah blah. Yah maybe 80 years ago. Medical, school, any debt will destroy your credit. Figure it out before that happens. 

I had more I can’t remember now though lol. Here’s the link for the credit report, this isn’t some random link I found. I’ve used it plenty of times.

I made myself a cup of coffee with very good beans that had been sitting in my cabinet, already ground, for a few weeks.* I wasn’t expecting the freshest, most spectacular flavor, but my first few sips were pretty lackluster. That didn’t mean I wasn’t going to finish it, but it wasn’t a treat. Before I continued, I decided my morning breath was also not helping, so I went to the bathroom and scraped my tongue and rinsed out my mouth with water. 

I returned to my coffee and my next sip was amazing! I had removed all the overnight gunk from my taste buds and was actually able to pick up on the roast’s richness and complexity! 
I’m not so much surprised as I am glad to be reminded that I have the power (with a tool that costs less than $5 at the pharmacy) to enhance my enjoyment of food and drinks while contributing to my oral hygiene.

M: Measurable - Is it something that you can track or measure progress with?

A: Achievable - Is it truly something attainable or are you planning on becoming immortal?

R: Relevant - Is this goal relevant to the vision that you have for your lift?

T: Time-based - Is it something you can set a time limit on?

LifeProTips,"This happened to me many years ago but I was reminded of it by something else. At my father's funeral, a lot of people said they didn't know he had a daughter. Not terribly surprising; we were adults and he had moved to a different city, I was from his first marriage, and he wasn't terribly sociable so their social life revolved around his second wife, who didn't know me well. But it was still very invalidating and hurtful in that situation. The people saying it were innocent, but don't do this, folks - if you're the fifth person to say it, it sounds very much like ""You weren't a very important person in their lives, they didn't even tell us about you.""

*Edit:* Really surprised how controversial this has been. To me it seemed like a fit for LPT because (1) many people do say it at funerals (as shown by replies here), (2) many people do find it unintentionally hurtful (also shown by replies), (3) I assume most people do not go to funerals intending to be hurtful to family of the deceased, and (4) it's well known that people don't know what to say at a funeral so having a canned phrase at the ready as a substitute is useful, even if it isn't the best phrase ever, because that makes it less likely that you'll flounder and use the hurtful one.

LifeProTips,"I get bad anxiety attacks often, and also have my depressive days ( I have bipolar disorder, so ups and downs are common for me). I noticed that trying to fight off my anxiety and lack of will to do things on my bad days usually makes me feel much worse about not being well disposed than when I just accept I am not ok at the moment and just take it easy for a while. 

When I am having a bad anxiety attack (and breathing exercises, distractions etc are not working) I just lie down and take deep breaths, and embrace the horrendous moment keeping in mind that it feels bad right now, but it will pass and i'll be fine afterwards. Trying to outrun my anxiety usually just makes it much worse.

I figure this applies for most bad times we have; it's important to try to get better, but it is paramount to aknowledge that there will be moments we are not going to be ok, and there is nothing wrong with that.

LifeProTips,"Gambling can be addictive and I would never encourage anyone to bet. However, I enjoy it and have budgetted a certain amount of money for sports betting.

Using myself as an example, I can tell you at a glance by looking at my spreadsheet:

I am £148.50 DOWN for the the month of August. I have literally lost £148.50 to sports betting this month.

If all my best had come in I would be £958 UP.

I have gambled £490 total.

Most people who gamble only tell you when they win. So I wouldn't be lying when I tell you I've 'won' £341 this month, but it's quite obvious that I'm a losing gambler overall.

Even though I have lost some money, it's easy to check these numbers at a glance and just as importanly ACCEPT this money has gone. Just like the money I've spent on takeout or movies or anything else this month I have no way of reclaiming this money.

I have gambled my budget for this month and I am stopping until next month.

If you enjoy betting, gambling, playing poker, etc etc decide how much of your disposable income you can afford to spend on it and STICK TO IT. Make yourself a spreadsheet so you can track how much money your vice/hobby is costing you.

Most importantly DO NOT CHASE YOUR LOSSES. DO NOT THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD.

LifeProTips,"I'd like to discuss some debate and discussion tips I've learned and adopted through my career as a designer. Our day-to-day jobs are filled with constant feedback, disagreements, explorations, discussions, and nitpicks. The goal is to get to better solutions. Furthermore, I'm also someone who has had experience in working with customer service and designing conversations.

Over the years, I've noticed a lot of overlap in design debates with internet debates. Defensive, insecure, ego-driven designers often share similar traits to bad-faith debaters on the internet.

This is not a comprehensive list. I hope that in posting this, I can also learn some things in the comments from other contributors as well.

TIPS

1. **Debate to learn, not to be right.**
   1. Let go of the war metaphor in debate. This [TED Talk by Philosopher Daniel H. Cohen](https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_h_cohen_for_argument_s_sake) really articulates why pivoting from that mental model can help discourse.
   2. A corollary of this is avoiding clickbait ""X DESTROYS Y"" type of discourse. Not only do these types of arguments mostly reward speed, preparedness, and pithiness, I don't think people really learn anything from it. It's mostly for entertainment.
   3. Corollary 2: This reframes the person you are arguing with as a debate partner, not opponent. It should be apparent why this is important on work teams.
2. **Strengthen your partners argument.**
   1. This seems counterintuitive, but if I disagree with someone who has a weak argument, I try to make it clear I am pushing back to help them strengthen their argument, not to prove that they're wrong. If they're truly wrong, this process will take care of itself.
   2. This is one of the most difficult. I have trouble doing this when I truly disagree with someone on social issues, which brings me to Tip #3.
3. **Don't say ""Change my mind.""**
   1. This framework popularized by commentator Steven Crowder has been maybe the most toxic meme I've ever seen in internet culture. It frames you as an immovable entity and puts the onus on your debate partner to work around you.
   2. Instead, ask, ""What are the foundational beliefs/frameworks that I would have to change to agree with you?"" This does a few things: If your partner has a poorly defined argument, it forces them to do the work in a non-combative way, since you're showing that it's possible to change your mind. It forces them to ask you questions about your beliefs, minimizing strawmen and preventing discourse spiraling. It also allows you to know if there is any further point to discussion (*e.g. There is almost no point in debating certain topics related to sex if one person ties a lot of religious morality to sex, while another doesn't. Identifying that early will save time. Then it allows for more healthy debate on more core beliefs about sex.*).
4. **There is a time for pithy and sarcastic responses for entertainment.**
   1. This can be okay if there is a lot of trust and psychological safety in the group. That's generally not the case for internet arguments with strangers. Just know that if you start to introduce this into an earnest internet debate, you're going to derail it.
5. **Likewise, stay away from personal attacks. It's completely pointless.**

LifeProTips,"When buying a car there is an instinct to haggle, because if you don't you're missing out. The problem is car salespeople do it for a living and their paychecks depend on it, so they tend to be better at it. In fact, the current sales model for most dealerships doesn't favor the consumer. Yet consumers keep it alive because they like to haggle. They expect it. What you want to do is get as much information as you can about pricing, trade in value and financing as you can so that you haggle less. 

CUDL or Credit Union Direct Lending is one way to make sure you're getting the best rate. Basically what happens is the dealership submits out your loan to a local credit union and you get the same rate as if you had gotten the loan through the credit union. If you contact your local credit unions in advance you can find out what their rates would be for someone with your credit history. These will be their best rates, not their best rates plus whatever the dealership decided to tack on. You can then ask for that credit union's rates and save thousands in interest over the course of your loan. This specifically applies to used cars, because usually on new cars you can get a promotional rate through the manufacturer. 

For new cars always go on the manufacturer's website and look at what promotional rates they have going on, and read the fine print. It might not be something you can combine with other offers. 

On the subject of rates, beware 0% financing. Money always has to come from somewhere and there is no such thing as a free lunch. If it's coming from the manufacturer and it's something they regularly do, it means they're either cutting costs on making the car or jacking up the price to compensate. They have to do it to remain competitive and profitable in their industry. The same goes for any other freebies like oil changes or maintenance that gets thrown in. 

It's like free chips and salsa at a restaurant, they aren't free, they are worked into the cost of the meal. And if they are raising the price of the cars to make up for it, you're paying sales tax on that difference.

So why does that matter? Money is money. Either save it on interest or save it on the price of the car, right? Nope. If you have the option to pay 2,000 more in interest vs paying 2,000 more for the car you always want to pick the first option, because you aren't paying sales tax on it. Secondly, in many states there is no pre-payment penalty. So you can pay an extra $100 per month, pay off the loan early, and not pay as much in interest. Where as if it's a 0% loan it doesn't matter how quickly you pay it off, you already paid the interest upfront, it was worked into the cost of your vehicle. 

Vehicles with 0% financing also tend to have greater depreciation, so if you sell the car or total it that can bite you in the ass. This matter less though the longer you own the car for.

That's not to say pass on 0% financing, if it's the car you want and it is available, go for it. Just be aware it isn't actually free. 

TLDR: Find out interest rates in advance from your local credit unions before going car shopping. 0% isn't actually 0%. There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Oh yeah, and some used cars do sell quickly, so they might not be there the next day. An easy way to tell is to look up online how long the car has been on the lot. If it has been there for months, chances are it isn't going to be sold out from under you. You might even be able to get a better price if the manager wants to get rid of it. 

If it's in the first few days of being listed, and you're there checking it out, chances are other people are too. So it might sell. To give a blanket statement otherwise shows a general lack of understanding.",LPT: There is a lot of bad advice out there about buying cars and how to deal with dealerships.

They have to do it to remain competitive and profitable in their industry. The same goes for any other freebies like oil changes or maintenance that gets thrown in. 

It's like free chips and salsa at a restaurant, they aren't free, they are worked into the cost of the meal. And if they are raising the price of the cars to make up for it, you're paying sales tax on that difference.

So why does that matter? Money is money. Either save it on interest or save it on the price of the car, right? Nope. If you have the option to pay 2,000 more in interest vs paying 2,000 more for the car you always want to pick the first option, because you aren't paying sales tax on it. Secondly, in many states there is no pre-payment penalty. So you can pay an extra $100 per month, pay off the loan early, and not pay as much in interest. Where as if it's a 0% loan it doesn't matter how quickly you pay it off, you already paid the interest upfront, it was worked into the cost of your vehicle. 

Vehicles with 0% financing also tend to have greater depreciation, so if you sell the car or total it that can bite you in the ass. This matter less though the longer you own the car for.

That's not to say pass on 0% financing, if it's the car you want and it is available, go for it. Just be aware it isn't actually free. 

TLDR: Find out interest rates in advance from your local credit unions before going car shopping. 0% isn't actually 0%. There's no such thing as a free lunch.

Oh yeah, and some used cars do sell quickly, so they might not be there the next day. An easy way to tell is to look up online how long the car has been on the lot. If it has been there for months, chances are it isn't going to be sold out from under you. You might even be able to get a better price if the manager wants to get rid of it. 

If it's in the first few days of being listed, and you're there checking it out, chances are other people are too. So it might sell.

LifeProTips,"So, let's say for some reason you want to the thumbnail of a Youtube video. Back then, you could right-click on it, and download. But now, with the preview of the video, this will only lead you to a small-sized gif.

Every video is uniquely identified by it's ID (in 11 characters in the URL, it's after the `/watch?v=`, for example `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`, the ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`).

What you want to do is copy this ID, and input it in another URL:

From here you can download it (ctrl+s, or right-click -&gt; download image).

LifeProTips,"I just read a (now deleted) post about someone asking if they should re-sign because a dealer called them several times for $600 more down and a higher interest rate from 5.1% to 6.1%, or something like that. I got motivated to build off my comment to that post and add it to this sub.

**1a.** Always read the terms of any contract you sign. I like to read a contract at least 2x. If you need help (fine print and often confusing language) do your research and use the many free resources online to ask for help (like in 
r/legaladvice).

 **1b.** Be very careful to always redact any personal, identifying information about yourself whenever asking for help on said contract.

**2.** Don’t ever, ever re-sign if the terms are worse for you. Even if by $1 worse. Never ever. That goes for literally any contract you sign. Worth repeating: **any contract**.

**3a.** If the dealership, or any other contract source calls you again or just doesn’t take no for any answers, just simply say: “Well, I’ve already said no, but let me check with my lawyer. They’re great at contract law. They’ll know how to advise me on this”.

 **3b.** Whether or not you have (or even know a lawyer) is irrelevant. The people who’re calling you to re-sign will probably shit their pants and stop calling you at the mention of you saying the world “lawyer”. If you don’t have the car, or if the contract source is holding your product or service due to you hostage, they’ll probably expedite the delivery of said product or service to you once you say that line.

 **3c.** If you want to go a step further to get an Ace up your sleeve, I’d advise you post to r/legaladvice, with the same exact thing you’ve posted here and ask for help. Say “I told them I’d check with my lawyer, but I don’t have one. As a lawyer, paralegal, or someone who knows the legal angles here, what advice would you give me in how to deal with this”. Then follow that advice and stick to your wits. 

Good luck out there! **Never let anyone take advantage of you financially after you’ve already signed the contract.**

LifeProTips,"In retrospect I would re-title this-
 “If you feel like people aren’t noticing your efforts, make them more obvious”.

This can apply to many different aspects in life, but usually most often related to work or living situations with family or roommates. It can also apply to a loved one or other relationships

People are far more likely to notice and appreciate your efforts when they happen in front of them or in a much more obvious way then when you do them in the background and hope people notice. People have many other things on their minds and there is often a decent chance they may not notice at all, or at the very least the impact of your efforts is far less if done in the background.

Example: If you live with family or roommates that expect a certain amount of chores or cleaning be done on a regular basis, try to do the chores in front of them or in an obvious way that causes them to notice. This will help solidify the idea that you are following through on your commitments in their mind much better than hoping they notice that the kitchen looks cleaner or that dishes got put away, etc.

As a kid I often would try to get things done without my family seeing me do them so they would be surprised when they got home and noticed, but I realized that they seemed much more appreciative when they actually witnessed the amount of time and effort that went into what I did, and other times they would not notice at all until I brought it up. 

I have had the same experiences with my roommate situations and our expected chores and cleaning duties. My roommates actually witnessing my efforts seems to go much farther toward them appreciated it and realizing I am pulling my weight compared to when I clean up and do chores when they are not home and do not notice.

This can also be applied to work. If a boss has asked you to do certain things, try to do them in an obvious way where they will notice you doing it (but not so obvious to where you seem like you are trying too hard, or dangling your efforts right in front of their face because that tends to look even worse). Often they will appreciate it more because they notice it more.

If you have a loved one or partner or even friend that has made it known they have certain issues or expectations of you, this can also be helpful. If you feel like the efforts you are making are going unnoticed, doing it in a way that brings more attention to the efforts you make (once again in a non-forceful, natural way) can be helpful in getting them to notice the work you are putting in to either making them happy, changing your behavior, or whatever the specific issue in your relationship might be.

Efforts that are more easily noticed have a far greater effect on a persons image of you than someone trying to work hard in the background without letting it be obvious how hard you are working, and then hoping people will notice your efforts solely based on your results.

I will reiterate though, this should be used carefully so as to not seem like you are always flaunting your efforts which can have the opposite desired effect. It can definitely be a balancing act.

Hope this tip helps someone!

LifeProTips,"***Edit:*** *as* u/NoBSforGma *pointed out, you really need to be TOUGH. It's fine to be nice and polite with a car salesman, but don't mistake the friendliness for anything more than them trying to make a sale. It's the same thing as dining out. The waitress isn't in to you... She just wants a nice big tip. If you aren't tough, I highly recommend car shopping with someone who is, who knows how to haggle and tell a salesman to bugger off.*

*Another good tip, courtesy of* u/cjr91 *-  Take the paperwork home with you also if you do sleep on it overnight. When I was buying my last car the numbers seemed off somehow between the negotiated price for the new car and what they wanted to give me for the trade-in. When I got home and added up the numbers without the salesman buzzing in my ears I found they sneaked in an extra $500 that was obscured by the total price of the new car being broken out into multiple line items.*

^(I'm also speaking mainly about purchasing a used car.)

This should come in handy for first time car buyers. It's very easy to walk up to a dealership, see a shiny car, get swayed by the salesman into a a test drive, and before you know it, you're sitting in his office and he's crunching your monthly payments. These guys make commission so they will do everything to get you to purchase the car - this includes purposely confusing you with pricing, promos and interest rate plans. They will always tell you that the car you are interested in may be gone tomorrow. In most cases, it will sit there for weeks, or sometimes months before someone buys it. Don't ever put a deposit on a car unless you have already been shopping around and you are absolutely sure that you've decided to make the purchase. Always sleep on it before signing a car contract, because asking for a deposit back causes salesman to become ravenous dogs in a last-ditch effort to get your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Make many visits to many dealerships. It may take a while, but a car is a long term expense with very little ROI. Don't drive off with something you may regret buying when your first payment comes through and it's 400$ with 250$ in insurance cause you just HAD to get that Nissan Murano V6 turbo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additionally**

* Purchase from a dealer if you can. Not a lot. Dealers usually have inspections done and include warranties. Lots just want to move volume and their interest rates are gouging.
* Don't ever sign a car contract until you shop around for insurance quotes.
* Se a car you like? Go back home, sleep on it, and do online research into the reliability of the vehicle.
* Go car shopping with somebody who is experienced in it, so you don't get screwed by greedy salesmen.","LPT: don't buy the first car you test drive. The salesman is lying.

When I got home and added up the numbers without the salesman buzzing in my ears I found they sneaked in an extra $500 that was obscured by the total price of the new car being broken out into multiple line items.*

^(I'm also speaking mainly about purchasing a used car.)

This should come in handy for first time car buyers. It's very easy to walk up to a dealership, see a shiny car, get swayed by the salesman into a a test drive, and before you know it, you're sitting in his office and he's crunching your monthly payments. These guys make commission so they will do everything to get you to purchase the car - this includes purposely confusing you with pricing, promos and interest rate plans. They will always tell you that the car you are interested in may be gone tomorrow. In most cases, it will sit there for weeks, or sometimes months before someone buys it. Don't ever put a deposit on a car unless you have already been shopping around and you are absolutely sure that you've decided to make the purchase. Always sleep on it before signing a car contract, because asking for a deposit back causes salesman to become ravenous dogs in a last-ditch effort to get your money.

&amp;#x200B;

Make many visits to many dealerships. It may take a while, but a car is a long term expense with very little ROI. Don't drive off with something you may regret buying when your first payment comes through and it's 400$ with 250$ in insurance cause you just HAD to get that Nissan Murano V6 turbo.

&amp;#x200B;

**Additionally**

* Purchase from a dealer if you can. Not a lot. Dealers usually have inspections done and include warranties. Lots just want to move volume and their interest rates are gouging.
* Don't ever sign a car contract until you shop around for insurance quotes.
* Se a car you like? Go back home, sleep on it, and do online research into the reliability of the vehicle.
* Go car shopping with somebody who is experienced in it, so you don't get screwed by greedy salesmen.",2020-08-20 22:57:21-04:00,2020-08-20,22:57:21,don buy car test drive salesman lie car sell hour shouldn reserve deposit ll immense pressure decide purchase isn dealer town shop smart quick edit u nobsforgma point need tough fine nice polite car salesman don mistake friendliness try sale thing din waitress isn want nice big aren tough highly recommend car shopping know haggle tell salesman bugger good courtesy u cjr paperwork home sleep overnight buying car number negotiate price new car want trade get home add number salesman buzzing ear found sneak extra obscure total price new car broken multiple line item m speak mainly purchasing car come handy time car buyer easy walk dealership shiny car swayed salesman test drive know sit office crunch monthly payment guy commission purchase car include purposely confuse pricing promos interest rate plan tell car interested go tomorrow case sit week month buy don deposit car shopping absolutely sure ve decide purchase sleep signing car contract ask deposit cause salesman ravenous dog ditch effort money x b visit dealership car long term expense little roi don drive regret buying payment come insurance cause nissan murano v turbo x b additionally purchase dealer lot dealer usually inspection include warranty lot want volume interest rate gouge don sign car contract shop insurance quote se car like home sleep online research reliability vehicle car shopping somebody experienced don screw greedy salesman

Go buy a kettle bell. Just one. That’s it. That’s all your expense. $30 shipped on amazon will net you a bell in your desired size. After that, it’s time to go to work (even in your PJs if you want)

In a conference call? Crank out some arm curls. Waiting for a response to an email? Skull crushers. There doesn’t need to be a routine; just getting your heart rate up throughout the day will keep those Cheetos off your waste and get you feeling better. 

Are you a gamer? Apply the same logic. I have really been enjoying Escape From Tarkov but even on an SSD, the load times can be 2-3 minutes to get into a game. Instead of wasting this time, i do 10 curls with each arm and 15 skull crushers. I may do this routine 5-10 times throughout a 2-3 hour game session which means I’m doing upwards of 100 curls on each arm, and 150 skull crushers PER DAY. 

That’s 500 curls a week. On each arm. 750 skull crushers a week. For $30. It simply can’t be beat.

LifeProTips,"I have been in the working world for over 25 years.  In that time, about 15 years of my career has been in leadership positions.  I have seen many people put in their notice.  I have also seen the company not want to lose traction on projects or just overall business processes, so they give them a counter offer in order to keep them.  

These counter offers have always been a short term plan.  The long term plan is to drum the employee out of the organization.  It starts by having the employee document things they are doing.  Some are asked to document their day to day, and others are asked to mentor someone like an intern.  Next, they start removing responsibilities from the employee.  It accelerates by documenting all the missteps by the employee.  Finally comes termination day and replacing someone who is less costly to the organization.

When you get that counter offer, think about the reasons why you are leaving.  Was it all money related?  Or was it a combination of factors like culture, bad boss, or poor business performance as well?

Yet, there are success stores when it comes to counter offers.  Some people have been able to keep their jobs for years after accepting one.  If you are hellbent on accepting a counter offer, make sure you have enough savings to keep you afloat for 6 months.  If you accept a counter offer without savings, you run a greater risk of not being able to pay your bills if you are cut loose.  In a job market like this, having more than 6 months is probably a safe bet.","LPT: Don't take a counter offer.

LifeProTips,"Bit of background: My Mom taught me this ""system"", and it surprises me how few people know about it... goes without saying that she was a Coca-Cola aficionado (never Pepsi! lol). I drink less soda now (I'm 46) than when I was younger, but when I do... Obviously this procedure applies to all other sodas, but to honor my Mom I will explain it with the one and only Coca-Cola (no affiliation whatsoever, just a fan).

\-**The perfect Coke is a Coke that is ice cold AND has as much carbonation as possible** (Mom used to call it being ""spicy"" for how it felt at the back of the throat).

To achieve this you need to avoid as much of the 'foaming' as possible, this is how:

a) The Coca-Cola should already be cold, and the best ones are the ones from the classic glass bottle (PET bottles and cans work, but not quite as good, machine dispensed coke sucks). Room temperature soda will never work, the contact with the ice and glass will make it fizzle out.

b) The container should be glass also, plastic or party cups also make it foam and don't maintain the coldness properly.

c) The ice (plenty of it) should not be dry! This is one of the most crucial aspects of this. Dried ice will always make the coke foam and lose the carbonation. The trick here is to pass the ice thru water BEFORE serving. Clear ice works better than white ice.

d) Serve the coke at an angle to avoid as much foaming as possible. Have the glass and coke bottle as close to horizontal as possible and the lips of both in constant contact. The liquid should not be airborne at any time.

LifeProTips,"One of the most important but never performed ways to stay safe online is by using a different password for every website. However, remembering all these passwords is impossible and writing them down isn’t safe. 

However, there is a way to write down passwords securely without needing to worry about someone stealing that piece of paper with all your passwords.

First, write down a different password for each site. Then, think of some manipulation that you NEVER tell anyone or write down. All you must remember is this manipulation (function).

For Example:
If I wrote down on a piece of paper my Facebook password is ilikecats467, I can have some manipulation memorized that changes that written down password to the real password I enter into Facebook! Such as: replace the third character to uppercase, add the first character again to the end of the passphrase, and add 1$ to the front of the password.

This technique allows you to write down ALL your passwords without worrying about its secrecy and if this paper was ever stolen or copied, the passwords are useless without knowing your manipulation function.

LifeProTips,"This is assuming you get the application for a mail in ballot *through the mail* in the first place. You still apply, then receive your ballot.

When people get their ballots, they **should bypass the federal postal service completely** IF they can:

1. Request a mail-in ballot.
2. Do not mail it.
3. Google your **supervisor of elections** to see where you can drop off your mail-in ballot. Its usually NOT THE POLLING PLACE. All states allow this!

Here is what you're accomplishing by doing this:

1. You're not relying on the USPS to get your ballot in on time, so no matter what, your ballot gets in on time.
2. You don't have to worry about standing in long lines and risking infection. You're just stopping by to drop it off.
3. You still voted! Hooray!

Also,   when you drop it off find out how to track it online to make sure it  is  verified. California, Oregon, Washington Colorado have systems that  can  track your ballot just like tracking a package from Amazon.

In the end, do what you feel comfortable with and capable of, but I hope this helps a bit.

edit 2: I kept getting asked questions about ambulance and I knew there was something I wanted to remember. I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it's not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it's really supposed to be kept by you.  

 I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate ""tip,"" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt.

So I thought I'd share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing &amp; collections agency.

**Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a ""Healthcare in the US is broken"" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn't the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post.

If you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I'll say ""hospitals"" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes.

***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:***

**Your debt goes in stages:**

* Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They're nice when it's still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there's no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL!
* Bad Debt **Contractors** \- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work
* Bad Debt **Purchasers** \- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt.

There are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don't know if there's an official term for each type, but I'll make up my own.

* **Contract** \- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount.
* And **Purchasers** \- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies.

***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:***

* **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it's medical debt.**

\--&gt; Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it's a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn't pay your portion, or if you didn't have insurance AND didn't attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so.

* **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.**

\--&gt; Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it's expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it's the last resort after a certain time frame, but ""Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid"" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren't resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it's common.

* **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.**

\--&gt; Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit &amp; stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue.

On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don't go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don't expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.

If it's a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn't worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we'd always send it if we couldn't convince the client to pay in installments. It's worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.

You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your 'proof of debt' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won't list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.

That's not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don't want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!

* **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they've got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!**

\--&gt; Bitch, please. They know it's yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn't they? The only thing you're doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.

* **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights**  
or  
**Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn't authorize them to collect the debt, and they're violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!**

\--&gt; Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They're not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn't know why you went.

* **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.**

\--&gt; Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don't report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There's no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don't report to credit on THIS account, if we didn't. But then we'd give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don't assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.

* **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!**

\--&gt; Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can't call/write/etc you, that doesn't stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.

It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom's car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility's network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).

* **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!**

\--&gt; In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it's you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they're calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it's your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it's name/address/year of birth. The agency's lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what's on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it's for your protection.

You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state ""collections"" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep's name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don't know if they're legit. If they are legit, they'll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they'll resend a letter if you tell them you'll pay, etc.

Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it's a scam. That's the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).

* **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!**

\--&gt; *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer's contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it's not foolproof.

If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.

If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we're not going to call back...but that doesn't always stop the process.

I don't know the time frame on that because I wasn't in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.

**LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:**

* ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It's always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.
* ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill. Their boss is going to mad if they take a low payment amount on a big debt. But they absolutely can take your payment of whatever amount you'd like. That being said, it doesn't automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you're making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.
* ***""This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.""*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you're in collections. Like, duh.  
They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don't miss a payment. But don't think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they're more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.

**MAGIC WORD:**  
**I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt. The agency should ask the reason for the dispute, but you do not have to provide it. They will then kick out an itemized bill to prove the validity of the debt. However - oftentimes if there was a dispute, we just closed out the debt altogether and were done, with zero negative consequences. I used to teach my agents how to tell the difference between a real dispute vs. a fake dispute, but in reality **if the D-word is said, it's a dispute.**

Good, valid, morally and ethically positive reasons to dispute a debt: I didn't receive that service, the appointment was canceled, I never got a bill in the first place, someone else was supposed to pay (divorce or car accident), identify fraud, I was injured during this procedure.

Bullshit reasons to dispute: The doctor was mean, I'm racist and the doctor was X ethnicity, I don't want to pay, my insurance should have paid this.

But again if you say **DISPUTE** \- they can ask more questions to see if it's a real dispute, but ultimately you CAN sue them if you tell them you're disputing it and they don't immediately pause reporting to credit while they investigate.

**THINGS YOU CAN THEORETICALLY SUE THE AGENCY OVER:**  
\-If you say dispute and they don't stop credit reporting to investigate - HUGE no-no; report per FDCPA.  
\-If they give out your health information to someone who was not confirmed to be you, per their verification process. HUGE no-no; report per HIPAA.  
\-If they say it's a **debt** before confirming it's you that they have on the line - FDCPA violation, do not pass go.

**What to do on every medical collections call:**  
\-Get the name of the agency and the representative you're speaking with; write down date and time. This may be needed in the future if they break FDCPA or HIPAA; it can also help with disputes or conversations with management later on.  
\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it's a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?  
\-Ask what happened with your insurance. How much did my insurance pay, did they say why this amount was left over?  
\-Call your insurance to see what happened if the agency isn't clear. There is a possibility that it can be re-billed even after it's in Bad Debt.  
\-Be friendly and polite. Agents have a good bit of freedom to grant discounts and set up comfortable payment plans, and they'll only use those kindnesses if you're not a douche.  
Also, they're humans too, probably making $2 above minimum wage, and the job is really tough because people are mean and have heartbreaking stories. Be human.

edit 2: I kept getting asked questions about ambulance and I knew there was something I wanted to remember. I finally dug through the old training manual I had created and now I remember - Ambulance billing SHOULD work the same as those below as far as disputes etc.. The exception that I remembered was: the reason people were going into collections CONSTANTLY for ambulance visits, was because ambulance billing is different. They send the check for the ambulance amount to the patient directly, so the patient will pay the ambulance bill - and then the patients would cash that check, and never pay the ambulance bill, and then get put into collections. As far as insurance was concerned, they DID pay the ambulance bill and it's not their problem. But the ambulance company never saw the $ because the patient would spend it. So - before you cash a check, make sure it's really supposed to be kept by you.  

 I got looped into a thread about medical collections that started with a very inaccurate ""tip,"" and saw that there was a FREAKING TON of misinformation floating around about what to do when you have medical debt.

So I thought I'd share the knowledge that I have on the topic from a few years as a trainer in a medical billing &amp; collections agency.

**Disclaimer**: I worked for one agency that had multiple sites nationwide in the US. I am not a lawyer, I am NOT giving legal advice. I am just sharing what I know from a few years in the industry including a competitor study that we did to find out how our competitors handle the same situations. I will not share the name of the company I worked for; they were most definitely shady in some areas and I am not looking to dox myself either. If anyone has more knowledge than me on the topic, please chime in. I am also not looking for a ""Healthcare in the US is broken"" because yeah no shit Sherlock; this isn't the thread where we can fix that. Oh also I will swear sometimes in this post.

If you have medical debt, these tips may help you to negotiate down or get the debt written off, or to ignore bad advice from people telling you to do something that could have negative repercussions. I'll say ""hospitals"" below but this encompasses all medical providers as far as my experience goes.

***OVERVIEW OF HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS:***

**Your debt goes in stages:**

* Early Out - debt is still owned and usually managed by hospital; may be outsourced to an agency. This is the stage where they can fix any insurance issues as well so **call as soon as you get the bill before it goes into collections**! They're nice when it's still in Early Out; they have to be aggressive when it goes into collections. Some hospitals send their bills from EO to Bad Debt in 30 days; some wait years. So call right away when you get a bill because there's no way to know their timeline. Oftentimes if the amount is low, they will just write it off or take a small payment in the EBO stage. They will work with you. Once it hits Bad Debt aka Collections, the options can be limited. Additionally, the GENERAL rule in health insurance is that you have to resolve the claim within 1 year. Medicaid/Medicare/Tricare had different rules, but in general - getting your insurance to pay after 1 year is not going to happen. CALL WHEN YOU GET THE BILL!
* Bad Debt **Contractors** \- still owned by hospital but using collection agency for the work
* Bad Debt **Purchasers** \- sold off to very aggressive collection agency who has little hope to recover the debt.

There are 2 types of med collection agencies - I don't know if there's an official term for each type, but I'll make up my own.

* **Contract** \- the kind that I worked for, that has an active contract with the hospital and gets a small % of the collected amount.
* And **Purchasers** \- the kind that purchases the debts in bulk at a discount and tries to recoup that money and more from you. Facilities usually go through **Contract** agencies before **Purchaser** agencies.

***COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS:***

* **MISCONCEPTION #1: Your medical debt cannot go to collections because it's medical debt.**

\--&gt; Yeah, right. I wish this was true. However, without the collections world, hospitals would close - so it's a reality with our current healthcare system. Know that if you were insured and didn't pay your portion, or if you didn't have insurance AND didn't attempt to get state coverage that would cover those bills, OR were turned down for state insurance....the debt usually lies on your shoulders. They can reduce it, do payment plans, etc. but they can absolutely put you in collections for your car accident, and they will often be forced to do so.

* **MISCONCEPTION #2: Medical debt cannot have any long-lasting affects on my credit or property.**

\--&gt; Falsity false, boys. It sure can. The only reason a hospital may not choose to report to the credit bureaus, seize property, or go after your income is usually because it makes them look bad to the community and it's expensive to do the above. But they can and do report to credit if they choose to. Oftentimes it's the last resort after a certain time frame, but ""Sir, this can affect your credit score if not paid"" can be the last option they can use in order to get payment from repeat offenders or low-income areas where the hospital faces a risk of closing if old debts aren't resolved - hospitals have bills to pay too, y'all. At my facility less than 10% of our providers reported to credit, but many still did and it's common.

* **MISCONCEPTION #3: Just telling the agency that you want an itemized bill will close out the debt.**

\--&gt; Oh god, false but **COMMONLY** spread misconception. Per FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act), it has to pause the collection process (stopping it from reporting to credit &amp; stopping phone calls while they order it from the hospital), but that may be all it does. Once the IB is sent, collection can continue.

On rare occasion, the hospital pulls up the IB and sees it was mis-billed or the insurance coding was wrong - but they don't go actively looking for problems at this stage, so don't expect that to happen just from your collection agent asking Sally Receptionist at XYZ Hospital to kick out an IB. You should have called sooner to get this resolved.

If it's a low amount, (for us $50 to $100 or less), it wasn't worth the admin cost of requesting an IB. If it was over that amount, we'd always send it if we couldn't convince the client to pay in installments. It's worth the postage and admin costs to get hundreds of dollars in payments.

You should know, though, that collection agencies ARE required to send you proof of the debt if you ask, and this is law per FDCPA. However, the statement that the collection agency sends technically counts as your 'proof of debt' because it will contain the date of service, provider name, facility name, and amount. It won't list out each service that was done. But the letter is technically enough to count as proof of debt.

That's not as good as the IB so you should push for the IB. They don't want to spend the $ on postage so they will try to avoid sending ANYTHING, but push for it!

* **MISCONCEPTION #4: Admitting the debt is yours means they've got you! Hanging up on them stops the process!**

\--&gt; Bitch, please. They know it's yours; they have your address and social security number and they got in touch with you today, didn't they? The only thing you're doing by acknowledging the debt, is confirming that they got the right John Smith on the line. But they pay for skip tracing systems and can and will find you, at every address you register to, and they can call your family as well at least once to get a better address or phone number for you. We paid a team of people minimum wage to sit and skip trace people all day, 40 hours a week. They can find you. They will find you.

* **MISCONCEPTION #5: Sending an IB is a violation of my HIPAA rights**  
or  
**Collection agencies collecting on medical debt are violating my HIPAA rights! Tell them that you didn't authorize them to collect the debt, and they're violating your HIPAA rights, and you get off free!**

\--&gt; Shut your stupid mouth. Every provider in the USA is required to have you sign something called a Notice of Privacy Practices. You prob signed your NPP in the giant packet before your first appointment. That NPP has very intentional language that lets them use any biller that they choose, and they are permitted per federal law (both FDCPA and HIPAA) to see the bare minimum of your medical info from the appointment in order to collect. They're not violating that law because they can be fined tens of thousands of dollars per violation. Trust me, the paperwork is ironclad. And if my company was any indication of the industry, most of our hospitals did NOT share the reason for the visit, diagnosis, etc. because that was not needed info for collections. We could infer the reason if say it was a labor and delivery provider, but we didn't know why you went.

* **MISCONCEPTION #6: My medical debt has no real consequences on me if I ignore it long enough.**

\--&gt; Eh, maybe. If that hospital does not report to credit, and the second agency does not report to credit, and the agencies that buy the debt off don't report to credit, then yes - you may not have your credit score affected. There's no way of knowing what agencies they use and what future policies they may follow when it comes to reporting to credit, though. My agency could legally tell you no, we don't report to credit on THIS account, if we didn't. But then we'd give the account back at 90 days, or 1 year, or whatever, and then the hospital would switch the debt over to our competitor for 1 year, and those bastards did report. So don't assume it will never report. Additionally you can be prevented from using that office in the future if you have outstanding bills. Some of our providers even allowed us to garnish wages.

* **MISCONCEPTION #7: Telling them to stop calling me stops all collections for this bill!**

\--&gt; Telling them to stop contacting you stops them from contacting you. If you say stop calling you, they cannot call you ever again. If you say stop calling this #, they can never call that # again. If you say stop contacting me, they cannot call, write, show up, send smoke signals, use a voodoo doll, etc. This is per FDCPA and you can sue them for literally thousands of dollars if they violate this so go for it! But - just because they can't call/write/etc you, that doesn't stop credit reporting, wage garnishments, etc. if those are in the pipeline of the debt.

It also legally prevents them from reaching out to you to let you know if they are offering a deal (we offered huge discounts during tax season, for example), it stops them from letting you know if you have future additional bills. Basically you're cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Now, if you know 100% beyond a shadow of a doubt that this bill and all future bills for this hospital will not ever hit your credit report, or if you have a 300 credit score and plan to live in your mom's car forever, then go for it. But again, you may also be prevented from seeing doctors as part of this facility's network forever as a result. (The ER is required to take you regardless of your payment history; nobody else is).

* **MISCONCEPTION #8: They are asking for my information when they call me; that must be fraud!**

\--&gt; In medical collections, they are bound by HIPAA in addition to FDCPA. They are allowed to ask for your name and give you the address they have on file to see if it's you. They are NOT allowed to mention that they're calling about a medical bill, details on the appointment reasons, or amount until they have confirmed your identity. They cannot tell your family member anything unless it's your legal spouse who verifies your info. ID verification varies but typically it's name/address/year of birth. The agency's lawyer may not be okay with them reading off your YOB so they may ask you to confirm what's on their screen. It seems shady, for sure. But it's for your protection.

You can never be too careful. Ask for them to send a letter. Get company name. Ask them what their letter envelope looks like - the FDCPA makes it illegal for the letter to state ""collections"" on the outside of the envelope (for your protection) so it may look like junkmail that you threw out; they have to keep the envelope relatively generic. Ask for the rep's name. Ask to call back in and talk to someone else. Tell them you don't know if they're legit. If they are legit, they'll direct you to a website, a phone # for call-in, they'll resend a letter if you tell them you'll pay, etc.

Look up reviews for the agency. But, be aware that the ignorance around collections is widespread and 99% of the bad reviews are going to be people who think it's a scam. That's the nature of collections. But they should be legitimate. They should have a web presence. They should have ads on indeed and other websites to hire people (Collection agents turn over more often than a sex worker in a threesome with one really tall man and one short fat man).

* **MISCONCEPTION #9: If you tell them you have a lawyer, the call is over and collection efforts stop!**

\--&gt; *Maaaaybe*. We asked for the lawyer's contact info, advised the consumer to have their lawyer contact us, and immediately stopped all communication to the client and reached out to the lawyer. That stopped all calls and letters and stopped any credit reporting. That being said, if no lawyer contacted us after a certain amount of time, it could begin reporting again in the future. So it's not foolproof.

If the lawyer you gave us confirmed that they do NOT represent you, we could legally reopen.

If you hung up after saying you have a lawyer, we were stuck waiting to hear from them and if you were lying, well... we're not going to call back...but that doesn't always stop the process.

I don't know the time frame on that because I wasn't in the Legal dept, but there was definitely a limit to how long we waited before reporting to credit.

**LIES COLLECTION AGENTS TELL YOU:**

* ***You have to go through us to pay this debt.*** This may not be true, if the debt exists back in the Contracted stage. The hospital MAY still talk to you about this debt if you call them directly. It's always worth a try. They tell you to go through them because they want their commission if you pay.
* ***I cannot take less than $x per month for this bill.*** Nah fam, that agent is simply not going to hit their monthly bonus if they let everyone pay $25 per month on a massive bill.

That being said, it doesn't automatically stop it from reporting to credit just because you're making payments. When you set up a payment plan, ask if it stops the credit reporting process just in case.
* ***""This is a binding contract; if you miss any payments on this payment arrangement, the balance in full is due.""*** Bro, the balance in full is already OVERdue....you're in collections. Like, duh.  
They are just trying to lock you in to the payment arrangement. Now if you do miss a payment, it can instantly report to credit - so don't miss a payment. But don't think that your $5000 debt that you agreed to pay out at $200/month is suddenly going to go back up to $5000 due tomorrow if you miss a payment. You already owe $5000. They can and will set up your payment arrangement again. Just call them and ask them to move the date if you need to; they're more than happy to do it. Especially since the new collector could get the credit for the new payment arrangement which goes toward their bonus - hooray for them.

**MAGIC WORD:**  
**I DISPUTE the validity of this debt**. Oh hell yes, use this phrase. It stops all collection efforts, stops credit reporting, and basically creates a full system shutdown on this debt.

\-Ask as many questions as you need to in order to help you learn if it's a valid debt. When was this, who was the provider, how much was my original bill, what insurance did you bill to, do I have additional bills in your system?

UnethicalLifeProTips,"My dad sucks. He beat my mother growing up, left me with a pedophile (it ended the way you’d expect) and constantly villafied my mother growing up. I was raised by my mother and have lived with him a year out of my life. That year was split up between him losing custody because he started drinking again (he is and was a huge alcoholic), then me moving in with him in adulthood only for him to kick me out (in 95 degree weather without any warning whatsoever) in an attempt to manipulate me into letting him sell my parrot. I tried time and time again to have a legitimate relationship with the man but I’ve never been successful. 

Now, I don’t hate people because they’re alcoholics. It’s a tough addiction And I applaud anyone who tries to get over it. My father, however, is a mean drunk. Very mean. He punches holes in the walls, disowns me and reowns me, tells blatant lies about my past and tries to guilt me into feeling sorry for him. 

After not speaking to him for a year, I’ve just heard that he may be in liver failure. He has two houses, one on mortgage and another he owns outright. I would like to inherit them because owning a house would be a huge step up in my life at my age (22). 

My father supposedly has narcissistic personality disorder, though I’m not sure if that’s diagnosed or not. If it isn’t, he definitely shows symptoms. Here’s my request: 

How can I contact him again and rekindle a relationship without him being suspicious? I’m not the manipulative type most of the time and already feel guilty considering doing this. My concern is that I’m sure my dad would put something in a Will saying I don’t get anything. I’d like to be on his good side. At this point he’s ruined my life once and tried to twice, and beyond the requisite “he’s my father” I don’t care all that much about him. I don’t want him to die, but if he is going to, I don’t want to miss out on an opportunity to get a house.


Edit: so I’ve been talking to the girlfriend. He’s gone batshit, more so than I thought. He’s drinking even more than before, trying to start fights with the other roommate, and then calling the police on him when he doesn’t do anything. He’s told the girlfriend she’s not getting anything because she spoke to my mother (not even told my mother, just spoke to her). 

I’ve sent a message about him being sick, but deleted it before he received it (checkmark wasn’t filled in). It said “delete for you” though so I’m worried he’s seen it. If he does and flips out even more at the girlfriend I’m not sure what I should do.

Edit #2: I’ve decided not to contact him.

I have Aspergers. For those of you who think I’m evil I know that sounds like a dumbass excuse but I have a reason for telling you this. As much as you may think I’m a liar, I have never intentionally manipulated anyone in my adult life. I’ve always tried to be kind to the people I like and nice to those who hurt me. I came on hoping people who knew better could tell me how to get my dad to forgive me for whatever he thinks I’ve done and begin to value me again. Many of you delivered on just that or offered other advice on the matter. I thank you all, but I don’t believe I am mentally capable of pulling this off. 

 My social ineptitude was showing because I didn’t know that this post would upset so many people. I know now that it’s upsetting to many of you, though I’m not sure I understand why. I’ve seen so many people lie to each other about how they felt about others then hurt them, I never intended to hurt my father in the scheme I had. If my plan necessitated a “Ha-ha! Gotcha!” Moment or a piece of revenge, I’d never have considered it. To me, it meant he died happy and I got something out of it too. Definitely not selfless, definitely the most sleazy thing I’ve ever considered doing, but not something I thought would get me sent hate mail. 

I will admit that I still don’t feel as guilty for having wanted to do this as many of you expect me to. I don’t understand why it makes me a terrible person. I thought feigning interests and making people like you was commonplace, even if I’ve never tried it. I feel guilty for considering lying, but I feel guilty for telling coworkers I have plans when they ask me to cover their shift. I understand death and him being my father adds another factor, but I don’t get how it turns it from unethical to “fuck you”. I wasn’t trying to screw him over and didn’t see that as a possibility.

Maybe it’s because I never got to have the cliche father/daughter relationship. I think all of you are reading this as a person trying to do this to their dad, not the sort of relationship I have with him. I found that most people who said they have a parent with NPD were rooting for me. 

I have confirmation that he is not senile. My father is 50 with no known history of dementia in the family. I spoke to him a year ago last time he disowned me and he was fine mentally, save for having suddenly decided that he hated me. 
“He’s gone batshit” just means his drunken antics have increased. He isn’t doing anything to make me think he’s gone insane so much as he’s pissed at the world and lashing out at everyone around him. I spoke to his girlfriend and she confirmed he’s coherent, just drunk and acting the way he does when he’s drunk and has no one else to attack. If I thought for a second he was senile I’d have taken much more issue with lying to him. 

That said, many of you were asking why I wanted the houses if there was so much baggage with my dad. I will be honest and say that I struggle with adult life despite doing well at school. I’m 22 and I don’t have many of the skills I should at my age. I don’t have a credit score and every attempt to get one has been thwarted. I don’t see myself ever being successful enough at life to get a house of my own unless I got lucky. I saw this as my only chance to own a home, even if I sold the mortgaged one and bought a smaller home elsewhere. It would be difficult to figure out but I have a relative who does real estate who could’ve helped me. Maybe I’d have had to live with it the rest of my life, but I might be living a much better life if I had. 


TLDR; I was asking how to get my father (who disowned me because of his NPD) to like me again so I had a chance of getting an inheritance. I have decided not to contact him due in part to my belief that I don’t have the social skills to do such a thing and because I didn’t understand the social implications of posting this.


FINAL UPDATE: thank you to everyone who was understanding.

He’s admitted to his girlfriend that he’s down 10% with 90% remaining, not down 90 with 10% remaining.","ULPT request: my abusive alcoholic father may be dying in six months, how can I rekindle a relationship with him and inherit his house?",t3_hplk3k,0.92,1,13619,1594544371.0,hplk3k,745,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/hplk3k/ulpt_request_my_abusive_alcoholic_father_may_be/,1,"ULPT request: my abusive alcoholic father may be dying in six months, how can I rekindle a relationship with him and inherit his house?

UnethicalLifeProTips,"You sleep days, so.... you rent a large storage room at one of those self-storage places.  

Many of those places allow you to use them as Mancaves or makeshift workshops to hang out in all day. You just gotta keep the door open while you do it. 

 So you bring in stuff that hides your sleeping area. You can make walls out of shelving units filled with boxes to keep any management/nosey employees from easily finding you. Make it a maze/and or block their way with boxes so they cannot easily get to you. Buy a motion-detecting driveway alert or doorway alert that has an alert tone that is the sound of  a phone ringing (I own one that does this) to wake you up when someone enters your unit. 

Then you can jump up and act like you are reorganizing or any activity that isnt sleeping.  

You could also make a completely hidden sleeping area that no one can find .... like a large box you get inside to sleep. You can lock it from the inside. 

-----------------------

Another idea (while I'm at it).... make a deal with another person that roughly looks like you that works days so you can alternate your sleeping in the unit. You go to sleep during the day... your partner leaves and locks you in until he comes back from his job after his shift, and you switch places. You lock him in while you go to work. Note: be sure to have a power tool in the unit that can easily cut you out in case of an emergency. Both wear the same outfit when coming and going so it appears as if the same person comes in for a 20 minutes or so and then leaves. So any employees seeing you (or watching security camera footage) will think you are the same person. 

This would be ideal for places that just have ridiculously high rent prices.

UnethicalLifeProTips," Hi! I bought my first house 3 years ago. When I bought the house, there was water damage on one wall in the basement at the bottom of the wall. The seller gave me a $10k repair credit, and I had french drains put in along the wall. We didn't bother replacing the drywall at that time because we are basically never in the basement and it was cosmetic.

Yesterday we were in our basement and noticed water damage coming down from the top of the wall, above the ground-line outside. It looks like it might be from the ceiling. We've been having issues with our garbage disposal in our kitchen not working and this spot is right below our kitchen sink and dishwasher. Based on my googling, this would not be covered by insurance because it doesn't seem to be a sudden broken pipe. You can see the bubbling and it feels slightly cool (barely) but not wet, and it's not like water is spraying everywhere. I think it's been going on for a while (maybe a week? a month?) but we just didn't know because we are never down there. Any tips on what we need to do or say to get this covered by insurance?

Edit: Since this got some traction I want to add to those of you new to college, a lot of universities  have minimum quotas they need to meet for different majors and many will have their college advisors really push you hard to get into something like a language major or something else you didn't really want to do so they can justify keeping those programs. Just be aware of that and stick to what you really want to try out in the end. My other advice is - if they let you- go in undecided as a major (once you gain admission). It's better to take a little bit of everything freshman year and figure out what you like because almost anything you take your first year will count towards graduation. However if you decide on something immediately and you tailor your first semesters around one particular major and end up changing later, it could extend your college stay and it will be tougher emotionally.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Let me clarify - canI use my spouses NON-CURRENT student loan to pay off my CURRENT student loan?

Maybe this is a rare circumstance and forgive me for my ignorance. 

My spouse is going to graduate school. I finished my masters and am making payments on my student loans (17K). My thought is since my current loan is accruing interest now and my spouse’s is not why not take out more in their student loans, pay mine off, and continue to make payments towards their student loan. 

TLDR:
My student loan: 17K accruing interest

Spouses (current grad student): 5K no interest until 6 months after graduation - can get 2X the amount needed for school in student loans. 

Solution? - consolidate both loans using Spouse’s student loan and thus utilizing no interest aspect. 

Anyone know if this would work? In theory this seems like a no brainer but feel like it is too good to be true. Thanks for any responses!

EDIT: Well fuck me. After doing more due diligence (and many smarter people’s comments), turns out that the spouses loan accrues interest immediately not like I was thinking.

He would tip me very well to save copies of checks throughout my day. Any check without alcohol and not over a certain amount on it and he would pay me $1 per check. It was nothing for me to do it for him, I would just print an extra copy and keep it in my book until he came in to collect them the next time.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/489589-senate-rejects-gop-attempt-to-change-unemployment-benefits-in-stimulus-bill

The new stimulus bill provides $600/week in unemployment benefits, in addition to existing benefits which vary by state, but usually amount to roughly half of your previous wages.

For example, in Illinois, if you make $52,000 a year, that's $1k a week. Get laid off, you get $600 + $471 a week in unemployment benefits= $1071 a week.

Now, you have to be clever. If you get fired for misconduct, you're not eligible for unemployment. So you can't just start screaming profanities to get fired.

Instead, start talking to coworkers about your salary and ask theirs. Start encouraging coworkers to form a union, in earshot of your boss.

It is illegal to fire a worker for those reasons, but it will make them try to find a way to lay you off, such as bad job performance(which doesn't kill eligibility for unemployment). If they try to dispute your claim, just threaten to sue them for violating right to unionize. They'll back off.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Honestly this could even be a LPT, but since it involves dishonesty I guess it goes here.

I interned at a company that bonded felons so they could get jobs (it's like insurance, if the felon steals the bonding company covers it).

Many high end jobs, even 6 figure salaried positions; don't background check. Almost all jobs however do ask if you're a felon.

**By checking the felon box, you're likely not even going to get an interview**. It's just the truth. Felons are the only class not protected federally by work equality laws. If you owned a business, would you take the felon or the equally qualified non felon?

**However, by NOT checking that box - You can get the interview, you can get the job**, and if it happens to come up later; you have a better chance of staying on board if they like you/are happy with your performance. Worst case, you get fired; which is no worse than not getting the job in the first place.

Government jobs, jobs involving children, nursing/medicine -- all background check.

Most business/corporate jobs however, don't (they may SAY they do, and they may ASK, but they usually don't actually check). Office/Admin/Sales positions rarely check. **I have a friend who made 370K last year as a Pharma Rep/Saleswoman for a huge Pharma Co. and she is a convict.**

Lastly, the jobs that usually DO hire felons, are doing it for a huge tax break; and will likely pay minimum wage (fast food, custodial, etc). Good luck supporting yourself with that salary. Also, a GOOD job willing to hire you knowing you're a felon, will slash your salary because they know you don't have a lot of options.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Edit preface: Didn't expect this to get any attention. Some of you are taking this *way* to seriously. This is meant to be humorous. I'm not actually suggesting anyone do this. Nothing in this sub should actually be taken as advice. It's comedy people.

I was reading a post earlier on how owners of AirBnB are actually allowed to install cameras in common areas as long as they state this int he description. In the comments, someone was talking about how they have found hidden cameras in their rooms while travelling for business and staying in very nice, expensive and busy Hotels.

Based on this and other comments, it occurs very frequently.

A hidden cam will cost you about $50 online. One of these, a screw driver and an air vent, thermostat, lamp or whatever and you're golden; you could even just tape it under a desk.

If you called the hotel staff in and threw a fit, they will probably do just about anything to prevent you from leaving a bad review or getting the press or police involved.

Free room, upgraded room, meal &amp; drink vouchers, you name it.

Should probably file down the serial number and buy a SD card with cash somewhere local to really sell the thing, just in case. But in all likelihood, they want to sweep the whole thing under the rug. It's probably \*actually\* happened before. The hotel staff may even be doing it in other rooms.

Your goal is not to actually get police involved, just to threaten that, or other legal action. 

Probably wouldn't work in an AirBnB setting, so stick with big name hotels.

Edit: To everyone saying that they will catch you with their own hidden cameras: so what?

That's the whole point. You're relying on the fact that they probably are aware of hidden cameras in the hotel. They're not going to give themselves up to out you. They'll be very happy to give you free stuff so you go away.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"To make a long story short, I'm a casual (not full time or part time - day to day) employee who has a verbal agreement to work a full time schedule. Though I have a verbal agreement to work everyday, I have been told I can take days off if I need to.

One of my shifts this week will be absolutely shit (in terms of the behaviour of those I have to manage, I know what it is in advance), but another workplace has offered me a shift on that day with possibly better conditions for more money.

I need a believable excuse that will allow me to take that day off but also allow for a credible cover story if I am questioned about going to work at the other place. The reason that I could be questioned is that the two workplaces are not too far away from each other and there are families that send their children to both of these workplaces -- I don't want to be in a situation where I get ""oh, we saw u/lana_del_reymysterio today"" and that gets back to the wrong people somehow.

My current idea was say I can't come in on that day due to needing to go to x appointment. My cover story idea if questioned is appointment got cancelled day of, figured too late to say I can work now, got a call from other workplace saying to come in so I accepted.

EDIT: It's not a question of if I can take a day off as I can and don't need to give a reason. However, I will need a backup plan (cover story) in case they do find out I was working somewhere else instead.

What my role is there is to full in for people and cover their release time (short periods/breaks from work) or days off.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Arizona makes you get a license that says interlock required so you cant drive any vehicles without it.
I had a breathalyzer in my car for a year and did get pulled over once or twice.  they would check my license and registration back at their car, and tell me they were going to wait until the interlock device went off to make sure i didnt fail the test.  My thought is that I've never seen them investigate the device and if it was really hooked up to the engine at all. Wouldnt it be fairly simple to make something that looks just like a breathalyzer, even a chord that attach to something under the dash, and it only passes you and isnt even connected to the car.  You could take it with you in any vehicle and probably get away with it..

UnethicalLifeProTips," I was a pizza delivery driver through a lot of college. Even though I didn't really mind working on my birthday, I realized one day while working on my actual birthday, it could be used to get more tips. If a customer asked how I was doing on that day, I said with some light sarcasm, ""Well, I'm working on my birthday, so I'm doing grrreat."" 

One summer while working for a pizza chain I hated, I decided to try out telling people it was my birthday about once a month. I always made bank. 

Part 2 (for Americans in particular): On these nights I made bank, a lot cash tips went straight to my wallet and I didn't report the tips to the company at the end of the shift. 1. because when management was looking at my card tips they already wondered why the hell I got tipped so much.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I’m renting an expensive studio apartment in California. A new neighbor moved right next door a month ago (we share a wall). Their dog (dog’s are allowed to live in the community) has been barking for long periods of time during the evening and has regularly woken me up multiple occasions during the early mornings. I took audio and photo evidence and notified management about it a month ago. They assured me they would contact the neighbor to work on a resolution.

The situation hasn't been resolved and management has supposedly been going through the legal process which they tell me they are unable to provide any more details about but have assured me will address the issue. That's been going on for several weeks now. In the meantime, I’ve been asked to call courtesy patrol when there is barking and I’ve done this repeatedly over the past two weeks, sometimes up to 5 times during the evening. The patrol service isn't having any success (not surprised) and are hesitant to send someone out. I've been calling still to document the issue and it's the only ""power"" I feel I have.

I recently signed a new lease, unfortunately, but I’m exhausted and this situation has been taking a toll on my personal and professional life. Also, I don’t enjoy going home because it’s turned into such a toxic situation for me.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Use the 7/11 app until you unlock a free item such as a drink or hotdog and screenshot the free item screen that you're supposed to show to a cashier.

Use the code once and it will no longer work.

If the cashier is told that the card was declined, they will usually either A: give you the item, or B: apologize for you losing the item and give you a coupon.

This varies by franchise, and some (if very few) will turn you away when you do this. The cashiers are trained not to accuse, and will *always* be non-confrontational, even when they know you're full of shit.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I'm in college for my second degree. Due to financial circumstances and medical circumstances before college, I qualified (and still qualify) for a long list of grants and scholarships. The first time I pursued a degree, everything was covered. Same with this time. Tens of thousands of dollars worth of scholarships and grants. The best part? I use it on whatever I want because of the significant amount that's leftover. I'm a disabled student with medical conditions, who's on disability, section 8 housing, LIHEAP, and food stamps. You may think that my leftover grant and scholarship money just rolls over to the next semester. It doesn't.

Instead, I get a refund through my school account (which can be used as a credit/debit card with my school account card to make purchases or withdrawal cash from ATMs). Then the process starts all over again during the next semester. My grants (and even some of my scholarships) are renewable. At the same time, there's always thousands of excess leftover on my account each semester. I've already bought a car, gone out to eat at many restaurants, moved into a better apartment, traveled (plane tickets) and also saved some of the money.

If you're in college, apply for every grant and scholarship you can find in which you meet requirements for. After rewarded, whatever is leftover after each semester charge will go to your account as a leftover refundable balance. You can do whatever you want with it. Enjoy!

UnethicalLifeProTips,"90% of the time people selling on Craigslist want to sell *fast* and need cash *now*.  But they don't want to feel ripped off.  So give them a super duper mega low ball, and then just a regular lowball.  Put the power in your hands, and *make* them feel like they are getting the better side of the deal. 



Step 1: create a Google voice account.  It's free.  It gives you a phone # connected to your Google account. You can call and text with it. 

Step 2: find what you want on Craigslist

Step 3: text the # on the Craigslist ad lowballing the shit out if them.  use this to gauge their response.  most stuff sits forever on Craigslist and buyers are often flaky, or just flat out retarded.  say theres a car up for $5k.  Offer them $2.5k with your Google voice account phone #. If they say yes then buy it, but likely they will say no.  Ask a lot of questions. Be interested, and reply quickly

Step 4: wait a couple minutes, and then text them with your real phone #.  offter them a little more, but not much.  so offer like $2.8-$3k for that car you just ""offered"" $2.5k with your Google voice phone #

Step 5: buyer will weigh his options, and choose the ""higher"" option, even though the 2 offers are coming from the same person (you) and one is super shitty, while the other is only slightly less shitty.  He's gonna take the higher offer, so offer what you want with your real #, and go 20-30% lower than that with your Google voice phone #


I've used this to get a car, a DJI drone, woodworking tools, a snowboard, and a camera.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Step 1: Make sure you have both apps downloaded.

Step 2: On both apps, put in the address and get quotes during NON-SURGE hours (I use this for rush hour in Manhattan so like 2pm when I plan to leave at 5pm.)

Step 3: Leave the app open for the lower priced one at the screen just before you click to call the car.

Step 4: When you want to leave during surge pricing, bring up the app (should still have the old pricing for that trip queued up) and call the car.

Step 5: The trip will still have the price it quoted you earlier.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I'm a web developer from CA, now living in Thailand. I'm a night owl so it works out for me. The business side of freelancing is a grind so I'm thinking of applying for remote employment using my old address in California.

No issues with citizenship or anything (I'm American). But if HR at my employer withholds state taxes and I report my location to the IRS as Thailand, which I've been doing for years, there could be a mismatch. Reporting my domicile as California would clear this issue but then cost a fair amount in CA taxes.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Hey everyone. My friend is a police dispatcher and he wanted to share some tips with us because his boss is a dick. Pretty much every police department uses radios to communicate, and not many agencies use encrypted systems.

**""How do I get set up?""**

If you live in a somewhat large city, chances are there might be a live feed of your area's radio traffic already being streamed. In that case, all you need is an app on your phone.

If a live stream isn't available, you can get a radio scanner for about $150 (for an analog system) to $300 (for newer digital systems). Not sure which one you need? Go to [Radio Reference](http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/) and put your zip code in the search box. It will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area. Click on the name of the agency, and look under ""Mode"". If it has ""A"" it's analog, ""D"" is digital, and ""M"" is mixed (use a digital scanner). If you see the letter ""E"", that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner won't work (see below for a workaround). A digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well. There are programming guides online, but many new scanners are plug and play: you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself. 

**""So what can I do with a scanner?""**

Lots of things, ranging from harmless to borderline-illegal:

* Listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them.

* Set your radio in ""close call"" mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby. That means there's generally a cop, paramedic, or firefighter nearby.

* Get the scoop on what's going on in the neighborhood.

* Use it when committing a crime. You can hear the police get dispatched, so you know when it's time to leave. You can also hear if they're going to a call on the other side of town, so use that to your advantage.

**""I hear them talking, but I can't understand them. What do I do?""**

If it's just them talking too fast, you'll get used to it. Trust me. It's easy to develop a ""radio ear"" in as little as a few hours of listening.

Many departments use ""10-codes"" which are used to shorten messages and provide some (very weak) security. Many of you already know a few, such as 10-4 for ""understood"". 10-4 is the only universal 10-code, but there are some semi-standardized lists you can find [here](http://copradar.com/tencodes/index.html). If those codes aren't the same ones used near you, look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department, they tend to be similar to local 10-codes.

You don't even *need* to know what the 10-codes are for certain crimes. When a call is dispatched, the address is almost always given in an uncoded format. For example, we might say:

&gt; All units, 10-35 in progress at 123 Main Street. Responding units acknowledge.

So if you're breaking into the house at 123 Main Street, you don't need to know that a 10-35 is a burglary, you just know that the cops are on their way and it's time to get out of there. Also listen for alert tones (such as a long, steady beep or a ""wee-woo"" warble tone) that often indicate a serious crime in progress.

If you hear static or can't understand much at all, you might need a good antenna. Amazon sells a decent car roof antenna for about $15 and it's well worth it. Range depends on the antenna you get and the system they're using, but for me is generally about 20 miles from the nearest repeater.

**My local department encrypts their radio channels. What can I do?""**

An encrypted system isn't the end of the world. If you plan on using a radio for... less than legal reasons, then it's easy to steal one. Call the cops for a routine theft report or something, and have someone else steal the handheld radio from the car. Dispatch can remotely deactivate a radio, but we very rarely do unless you transmit on it and disrupt our operations. The NYPD has been having issues with stolen radios and they don't even encrypt most of their channels.

**Anything I should be careful about?**

Yes:

* A few states (such as Florida and New York) prohibit the use of a scanner in a vehicle, unless you're a licensed amateur radio operator (which is an easy license to get).

* Using a scanner during a crime can get you extra charges, depending on where you live.

* Dispatch has no way of knowing if you're using a scanner, but officers will often let us know if there are scanners located at an address so we can update our records.

* There are other ways for officers and dispatch to communicate. They will often relay sensitive information (such as a criminal history) via phone or an instant messenger system.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"When you’re running late and inevitably need to speed, you can mitigate the risk of receiving a hefty ticket by practicing intelligent speeding. The idea is counter-intuitive—speed as slow as possible—but it actually makes a lot of sense. I’ll do my best to hash it out.

Accurately assessing these annoying circumstances is the key to “intelligent speeding.” Let’s take the example of a different car driving the speed limit (30mph) on a single lane road.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I learned a little trick (after being conned out of my deposit multiple times): deposit generally is one month of rent here (the Netherlands). And here they also tend to keep the deposit for some bullshit reason. So I never payed the last month of my lease.

Of course the landlord would complain about that, and I'd give them the run-around. We have very strict renter protection here so they can't kick you out for just missing one month of rent.

Than when I moved out I'd tell them 'I finally have the rent, but seeing you owe me the same amount, we're even'. Some would go apeshit, but fuck them. That only confirmed my suspicion the deposit would never have come back.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Preface (ULPT at the bottom):

This ULPT came about from making a complaint.

I had issues with account creation at the credit reporting agencies due to them not following the RFC standard/guidance for allowable email address characters (and other issues).

You may already know you can get a free credit report either in digital or hard form via each of the 3 credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, Transunion) each year. Just cycle around the 3 agencies over 3 years.

For me, it began with one of the agencies not accepting my \*correct\* answers to the security questions, so I couldn't get the digital copy. Calling made no difference.

Fine, I just went with a different agency and got it. Then I made a complaint at annualcreditreport (.com) and surprisingly got an unwanted hard copy sent to me in the mail from the original agency. According to them, I failed the security checks (wrong). But later on, I'll find out it came to me because of the complaint where \*NO\* security checks were done.

Then later this year I had to unfreeze my credit report for something. Again, I encounter issues with their site(s) and I make another complaint when customer support was useless.

Again, this instance was about UNFREEZING my report. I had NO interest in another credit report being sent to me.

annualcreditreport (.com) -&gt; ""Contact Us"" -&gt; ""Continue to contact form"" -&gt; ""Other"" -&gt; (check off whatever agencies) -&gt; other -&gt; Description.

This is what I did. You may only need to select one of the other options where you don't have to put in any information (description).

I think my complaint for that second time was about the web site and the useless support, or no way to contact a human.

Again, I'll emphasize that I did NOT want my credit report sent to me, just for them to fix their problems... but both agencies I selected sent me my credit report. Again, no security checks were done, and this is now 2 credit reports from 1 agency received in 1 year.

I'm flummoxed why I was getting these credit reports sent to me and calling support was again like pulling teeth trying to get an explanation. At least that one agency had a different contact phone number on the report that did let me speak to a human.

I finally made one last complaint that was also a test. I selected those agencies again, and explicitly stated that I did NOT want to receive any ""complementary"" credit report sent to me.

You can probably guess that I DID receive another credit report, but only from one of the agencies (so far). That makes it 3 hard copies from that 1 agency in 1 year.

I have no interest in hard copies. I only want the digital form. Being one who cares about the environment, it pains me. Then add on the fact that there is no security involved in getting the credit report shows that nothing was learned from 2017.

This is our society folks, enjoying the ride so far? It's only going to get worse.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Edit: Wow, I just realized how many fortunate circumstances had to come together for me to do this. 

First, yes, I've done it in college, some 7 years ago - and I got away with it. The subject was one of those secondary, ""optional"" ones that you really don't want to memorize. I'm shit at remembering names and dates, and this whole process took me less than 2 hours and was way more fun than trying to remember all the insane info.

Second, the worst thing that could have happened if I got caught is just failing the exam (cool policy huh?), and I could retake it as many times as I wanted, so no big consequences.

Third, they did allow students to bring labeled water bottles to exams, and our water bottles still mostly had regular paper labels, so with the small font of the same color as the original, no one suspected a thing.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"So for about two years I barbacked/bartended at a club. It was a combination restaurant/club with the restaurant on the ground level and the club underneath. The entire place was horribly mismanaged. Your typical ""one person quits and management expects everyone else to pick up the slack without compensation or hiring a replacement"" kinda deal. Checks would bounce CONSTANTLY, power would go out in the middle of a crowded night because the owners didn't pay the electric bill, the place was really a shit-show. Literally. We had horrible leaks that brought horrible smells which the owners did NOTHING about. Their solution was to burn an ungodly amount of incense and when customers complained just tell them ""were working on it.""

I was always treated very well there, but that's in large part because I was the only American working there. Everyone else was an immigrant who was in some way or another being taken advantage of. The owners knew that most of them did not have papers, worked multiple jobs, and needed this one as well.

As you can guess, the place was eventually shut down. It closed in late December, right at the height of the ""busy season"" for restaurants and clubs. We held a lot of private events, especially around the holidays, and everyone was making really good money. But then they closed down.

No one was paid for the month of December. We were told that the owners (a married couple, we'll call them Dan and Mikayla) were in debt to multiple people and that we would receive our wages once they had paid off their debt.

I was then informed by a coworker that they were planing to go before a judge to declare bankruptcy and that any employees that were owed money should attend the hearing and state their case. It is important to note that by the time they went before a judge I was in Europe for a semester abroad and was unable to attend the court date. My coworker who went said she was the only one who showed up. As I said, many of my coworkers were undocumented immigrants who didn't feel comfortable/weren't able to attend.

Well, the judge ruled that they DID NOT have to pay back any of their employees. I even got a letter in the mail stating it was ILLEGAL for me to contact them to request my money. This is infuriating to me as I know they have the means to pay us back and just hid their assets from the judge. (To give one example, they lived in one apartment, but owned two separate apartments in the building above the restaurant that they rented them out via airbnb for extra income).

They owe me $2,000. As I said, I was the only American working there, and I am very blessed to have parents who support me, so that $2,000 did not set me back as much as my coworkers. I can let that go.

What I cannot let go is the way they treated my coworkers. Particularly one coworker, we'll call her Emily. Emily was treated like dirt since day one. They worked her 7 days a week (even tho we're closed on sudays), she had bounced paychecks dating back for months. The owners even hired her to babysit for them, and they built up a very friendly relationship. But when they got shut down, they owed her about $6,000. Whats worse, because of an issue with her citizenship she was forced to return home to Europe and is not allowed back in the US. She has not seen a penny of her back-wages and at this point she has no legal recourse to get it back.

Some nights I lay awake thinking about how much I hate the owners. Not for how they treated me, but how they treated my coworkers. These are greedy, White, business owners who blatantly took advantage of immigrants (primarily of Hispanic or Eastern European descent) who ran their business into the ground and got off completely scot-free.

My current idea is to make a craigslist ad for an amazing restaurant job opportunity ($25/hr, 5 hour shifts, $300 in tips guaranteed per shift) and listing their email and phone number. But I am open to anything the great people of r/UnethicalLifeProTips might have to offer.

TL;DR: Restaurant owners took advantage/stole from myself and my coworkers and I want revenge!",ULPT REQUEST How to get back at my bosses who screwed me and my coworkers over?,t3_dv3mnl,0.94,0,99,1573555388.0,dv3mnl,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/dv3mnl/ulpt_request_how_to_get_back_at_my_bosses_who/,1,"ULPT REQUEST How to get back at my bosses who screwed me and my coworkers over? So for about two years I barbacked/bartended at a club. It was a combination restaurant/club with the restaurant on the ground level and the club underneath. The entire place was horribly mismanaged. Your typical ""one person quits and management expects everyone else to pick up the slack without compensation or hiring a replacement"" kinda deal. Checks would bounce CONSTANTLY, power would go out in the middle of a crowded night because the owners didn't pay the electric bill, the place was really a shit-show. Literally. We had horrible leaks that brought horrible smells which the owners did NOTHING about. Their solution was to burn an ungodly amount of incense and when customers complained just tell them ""were working on it.""

I was always treated very well there, but that's in large part because I was the only American working there. Everyone else was an immigrant who was in some way or another being taken advantage of. The owners knew that most of them did not have papers, worked multiple jobs, and needed this one as well.

As you can guess, the place was eventually shut down. It closed in late December, right at the height of the ""busy season"" for restaurants and clubs. We held a lot of private events, especially around the holidays, and everyone was making really good money. But then they closed down.

No one was paid for the month of December. We were told that the owners (a married couple, we'll call them Dan and Mikayla) were in debt to multiple people and that we would receive our wages once they had paid off their debt.

I was then informed by a coworker that they were planing to go before a judge to declare bankruptcy and that any employees that were owed money should attend the hearing and state their case. It is important to note that by the time they went before a judge I was in Europe for a semester abroad and was unable to attend the court date.

Get caught lying about little things, like eating the last [food item] or something. When you get caught, lie like a deer in a street lamp, be unconvincing and unconfident. After doing this a few times, you are seen as a bad liar.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Upstairs neighbor uses his studio apartment as a music studio. Blaring bass music at all times of the day. Throws garbage onto my fire escape ""balcony"" (so far it's been cigarette butts, toilet paper, and a used condom). 

I live in NYC in an old apartment with thin walls.

Tried talking to him in-person twice, always answers positively yet turns the volume of his music up as soon as I go back downstairs.

I have documented his noise in several videos, have videos of the used condom, and have also made 3 noise complaints so far to non-emergency line (311 in New York).

I just renewed my lease and my ~~slumlord~~ landlord ignored my emails over the past month.

My lease has a ""quiet enjoyment"" clause but I like my apartment and would like to get him evicted instead.

At the beggining I've been waiting, because transaction could be just delayed and I didn'I want to be hystorical. After 5 days of waiting, I've start to solve the problem. First I've ask on online chat what happen and the guy was very helpful and gave me telephone number to call some specialist that would trace and resolve my problem. Unfortunately, next day I've been waiting long time to connect me with specialist, which would not be able to trace my transaction for some reason and tell me to in 15 minutes). So I've called again and some girl (I don't know she's name but she was not the mentioned specialist, but was very nice to me and tolerable to my weak ensglish. But only thing I've been informate about was that transaction was lost and I should call next day to different number when they help me and resolve my problem.

And as I'm poor eastern European man trying to achieve better life for me and my girlfriend, definitely not bad person, but struggling with finances, I would like to get some advice how can I mine some money from this event. I will not hurt anybody from nice staff, I just want some advice how can I mine some money from the corporation.

My girlfriend is not dying from starvation, she was also able to make a deal with rent payment. I just want some advice how to exploit this situation for some smooth self-enrichment.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Sorry for the formatting. I’m On mobile. 

So I live in a duplex outside of city limits. But it’s a very tiny 2 bedroom. They’ve got 6 adults, a teenager, 2 toddlers, and 3 dogs living in that itty bitty place. They’ve constantly got at least 4 cars parked in a one spot carport. 

My neighbors are constantly hitting the walls and slamming doors. Now I live with my husband and 6 month old baby. And I try to recall any time I’ve touched or hit the walls and I can only think of a time or two and it was completely on accident. 

But when I say constantly, just last night at 4 am I jumped awake to them slamming things around in their house and proceeded to wake my baby. I’ve tried talking to them but it just seems like they’re careless. My landlord is an old lady who is going through dementia. I’ve asked her to help me get the neighbors to calm down a little bit. Every time she does, she suggests that I talk to them myself. Which I have. I’ve mentioned how they have entirely too many people living there but the neighbors claim that those people are just visiting. Every day. And night. Since they moved in. 

And something else minor but somehow it seems like someone is always outside smoking. So it stinks outside too. And they smell like absolute garbage and butt hole. I don’t even know how to explain it. It just smells horrendous over there. And they’re always outside talking and cackling. The toddlers also run around naked and screaming so loud I can hear them over the tv. I’m not sure how they’re banging the walls and slamming doors and being outside at the same time but there’s enough humans in that house it doesn’t surprise me anymore. 

I feel somewhat bad because the teenage kid likes to help out by raking our yard and looking out for snakes. He’s also helped when my dog escaped our yard. It just seems like everyone in that house is obliviously slamming things. It’s affecting us so much that we don’t really get any sleep anymore. My baby can’t take naps without constantly being interrupted. 

Any ideas on how to piss them off? Persuade them to move? Get back at them? Anything to give them a taste of their own medicine? 

I thought about getting a water gun of liquid ass and spraying it all over their yard and front porch. Maybe that’ll make them less inclined on staying around much. We share the same air conditioner so I can’t sabotage that. And they’ve made it clear that they have guns.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"I used to do this in college when I was poor and starving. Go to any major chain restaurant website and head to the ‘Contact Us’ section of the site. Carefully email them about your horrible experience with your family, significant other or friend. Tell them how disappointed you are because it was a special occasion and the horrible experience has lead you to never want to eat there again. Make sure to tell them you’ve never had these kinds of issues before and are very disappointed things turned out this way. 

Leave a good email and phone number with them because in my experience someone may call you to follow up. As long as you can stick to your story and detail what outraged you they will offer a GC as compensation to come back and try again with them to make it up. A week or 2 later the GC will arrive in the mail and the restaurant and staff are non the wiser when you use it. 

Here are some tips I’ve learned when doing this:

1) Never give your server an actual name. Don’t get anyone in real trouble. I always say they weren’t wearing a name tag and because it was busy you can’t remember their name. The name tag thing usually irks them more. Just give a basic one off description. 

2) Never say you paid with a credit card. They will search the the transaction logs to see if your name matches any CC receipts. Always say you paid in cash. They can’t track it. 

3) You want to tell them the food was cold, undercooked, or late. Refills were almost non existent. I always say the server was hard to track down. 

4) Keep your party size small. I always say 2-4 people. Make it bigger at your own risk. 

5) Always tell them it was a Friday or Saturday. Busy days are usually met with tons of people and it’s harder to keep track. 

6) Know your menu. Make sure you know what everyone in your party ate. Make it very common and popular menu items. If you get too crazy expensive then the I used cash option looks odd. 

7) Be prepared to speak to someone. They do call to apologize and hear more about your story. Not all of them (chili’s doesn’t fucking care) but some do. They give a more personal touch. 

8) Do your restaurant research. Some chain restaurants fall under the same parent company so they all have the same complaint department. For example, Olive Garden is owned by Darden Co. They also own Long Horn Steakhouse, Yard House, Cheddar’s Kitchen, Capital Grill etc. you don’t want to do this to more than one of the same restaurants under the bigger parent company. You will get caught quick. Just google: who owns X restaurant and see everything. 

9) Wait some time before doing this repeatedly to the same restaurant. I usually wait a year, but you can proceed at your own risk. 

10) Enjoy your free corporate meal or sell them for straight cash. Win win.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"This actually happened to me yesterday. I was at self check out, got 20$ cash back and forgot to grab it. I was at lunch during work and didn't realize I had for got my 20$ till I got home hours later in the evening.

I told them I didn't have my receipt and they said, ""no problem, it happens all the time."" 

So it got me thinking. You can potentially call any store that does cash back at self check outs and tell them you forgot your ""cash back"" money earlier today and wanted to see if someone turned 5, 10, 15, 20 or hell even 100 dollars that day.

UnethicalLifeProTips,"Most venues increase their prices for a wedding by an insane amount. This is true for cake shops, DJs, and other services that circle around weddings. You can get around this by telling them it's an anniversary party, or that you're renewing your vows.

I had a small wedding and planned a reception for extended family and friends way later on. I had been shopping around for venues since before the actual wedding, and couldn't get over how expensive they were. 

We planned the reception for about a year after the wedding, so after the actual wedding I told a few venues it was for an anniversary. Surprise surprise the cost was about half of what I expected. I tried calling back two of the places I had spoken to before, their prices were 35% and 50% cheaper. 

I talked to my buddy who was supposed to DJ the reception. He told me they charge about a third more for a wedding than any other type of party because their company knows people will pay it. My buddy who just got married tried this with his wedding cake shopping, same result. They didn't get to go in and do a formal tasting like they do for weddings, but they just went and bought a slice of all the cakes they were considering and saved hundreds.","ULPT- if you're planning a wedding, save money by telling them it's for an anniversary or renewing vows.",t3_da5fr2,0.98,0,145,1569642097.0,da5fr2,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnethicalLifeProTips/comments/da5fr2/ulpt_if_youre_planning_a_wedding_save_money_by/,1,"ULPT- if you're planning a wedding, save money by telling them it's for an anniversary or renewing vows.

After that I wrote it in my resume like it was a job and bam significant increase in the number of interview call backs. 

It's a perfect lie, no one can verify it, they can't ask you details about it without being a dick, you can be as vague as you want and no one will press you, and it makes you look like a goddamn selfless hero.

Edit: My biggest post on reddit is encouraging people to lie about dying relatives, I worry about what this says about me.

Edit2: So this blew up and I've seen a lot of comments questioning the importance of wage gaps so I'm going to use this little spot light I have to give some unsolicited advice from a managers standpoint. 

I work in management and I do a lot of hiring so I want to say in no uncertain terms that unexplained employment gaps do raise red flags, I get enough resumes on my desk that I have to narrow down real quick and employment gaps are an easy category to thin out my stack. 

That being said there are a lot of good reasons for employment gaps if you have one don't be afraid to put it in your resume if you learned something or gained some valuable experience or insight. You might have something that I can't get from Greg who worked accounting for 20 strait years.

If you spent your 2 years unemployed sniffing glue in your moms basement I can't help you besides telling you to lie but as a manager I just want to know that you did something valuable with your time.

In fewer words don't leave your employment gap up to my imagination I'm cynical enough to fill it in with glue sniffing or prison. 

Also just to answer this line of inquiry that I have seen definitely leave rehab out I have 3 other people just as qualified as you sitting on my desk that didn't just tell me that they (used to) have an impulse control problem.
