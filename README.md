This workspace contains project files and details for my DSI-16 course projects.

## Contents
- [Project 1: SAT and ACT Analysis](https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16_project-1)

Delving into SAT and ACT data across U.S. states from 2017 - 2018. Through exploratory data analysis, the project highlights insights from the data and makes recommendations for College Board to increase SAT testing rates in states.

- [Project 2: Model Prediction of Housing Sale Price](https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16-project-2)

Predicting house sale price based on over 80 categorical, ordinal, discrete and continuous variables.

The final regression model leveraged polynomial features transformation on the best explanatory variables recursive feature elimination and regularization.

- [Project 3: Reddit's r/LifeProTips NLP](https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16-project-3)

Natural language processing project delving into the subreddit r/LifeProTips and r/UnethicalLifeProTips

The final classification model created was able to distinguish posts from the two subreddits with approximately 80% accuracy, where the coefficients provided greater insight into the differences between the two subreddits.

- [Project 4 (Group Project): West Nile Virus Prediction in Mosquitos](https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/dsi-16-project-4)

Group project predicting West Nile Virus presence in mosquitos based on location, date and weather metrics.

The final classification model leveraged top explanatory variables shortlisted through cross-correlation maps and EDA, where the best model of 8 classification techniques tested was selected and tuned.

- [Capstone: E-Commerce Seller Performance Prediction](https://github.com/alexislimsh/dsiprojects/tree/master/capstone)

Exploratory data analysis and seller performance prediction leveraging a sample of real e-commerce data provided by the Brazilian company Olist. The model predicts seller performance based on seller category, product price features and product volume, where the decision-tree based Random Forest algorithm was leveraged.

Translation, word tokenization and topic modeling was also performed on the dataset of Portuguese reviews.
